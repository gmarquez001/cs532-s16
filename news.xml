         <title>Making their mark</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877951</link>
         <description>MONTREAL – Alex Galchenyuk closed out the year in style on Saturday night, and Max Pacioretty followed suit.

The pair entered the season finale leading the Canadiens with 28 goals each, and by the time the final buzzer sounded on the 2015-16 campaign both had attained the 30-goal plateau in a 5-2 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning at the Bell Centre.

It marked the first time two Canadiens players had scored at least 30 goals apiece in a single season since 2011-12, when Pacioretty and Erik Cole managed to accomplish the feat during a similarly tough year that also came to a premature end.

While Pacioretty reached the 30-goal mark for the third consecutive year – and the fourth time in his career – Galchenyuk made it happen for the very first time 57 days past his 22nd birthday.

In so doing, the Canadiens’ No. 27 became the third-youngest player in franchise history to register a 30-goal season behind Bernard Geoffrion and Stephane Richer, both of whom did it at the age of 21.

“I think it’s a good thing that I didn’t know about that. I didn’t want to put any extra thinking in my head. I tried not to think about it. When I was on the hot streak [back in late February and early March], I wasn’t thinking much,” explained Galchenyuk, referencing his outstanding point haul of 22 points – including 16 goals – in his last 22 games. “Then, 26, 27, and people start talking about whether I’m going to hit 30 goals or not. In the end, I just tried to go out there and play my game. But, at the same time, I’m glad I did it.”

It was the eighth time this season that Galchenyuk had compiled a multi-goal effort in the race to make 30 goals a reality. Earlier on Saturday, the Milwaukee, WI native claimed the Molson Cup as the team’s top player all season long, and he further solidified that standing with another two tallies to wrap up the season.

“I definitely improved this year. Coming in, I prepared well in the summer. I was excited coming in to play, try a new position and learn. I learned a lot of new things, and I think I matured a lot as a player. I think my offensive game got better and my defensive game also got better,” said Galchenyuk, one of four Canadiens players to play all 82 games this year while posting a career-high 56 points along the way. “At the same time, I’m only 22 years old. There still are a lot of areas to improve on. I like the direction I’m heading in right now.”

Pacioretty and fellow linemate Brendan Gallagher do, too. The trio combined to generate another eight points together on Saturday night, proving once again that they really do have something special to look forward to down the road.

“I feel really comfortable with the way our line played over the last month. As a duo, Chucky and I are getting more and more comfortable together. We know that we can improve the way we play, and right when Gally came back, he made our line more dynamic,” referencing Gallagher’s return to the lineup on April 2 in Florida. “It’s a real pleasure to play with them, and if we have the chance to play together again next year, we can definitely build on that.”

Galchenyuk is certainly in agreement there. As a unit of three, they’ve definitely got the ability to give the opposition fits and benefit from each other’s strong points.

“We’re hungry. We want to compete. We want to go out there and win games for our team. We want to be those leaders. We had pretty good chemistry towards the end of the year, which is a good, positive thing heading into the summer,” admitted Galchenyuk, who just completed his fourth NHL campaign. “At the same time, we’ve got to prepare well in the offseason. All three of us are looking forward to next year. It just sucks to end the season right now. It’s your last game without playoffs. It’s difficult. But, we’re going to learn from it and we’re excited for next year.”

As they should be, and so are the fans.

“The way the fans cheered at the end of the game was really special. I know that a few guys got pretty emotional. It definitely wasn’t the position that we wanted to be in, but we appreciate their support,” concluded Pacioretty. “They know what we had to battle through in terms of adversity. We know what we have to do to be better. I’m sure that we’ll remember that feeling all summer long.”

         <title>The Numbers Game: April 9, 2016</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877979</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - Here's a numerical look at Saturday night's season finale against the Tampa Bay Lightning.

200 – Number of games Paul Byron has played over the course of his NHL career, including Saturday night’s contest against the Tampa Bay Lightning at the Bell Centre. Byron, who claimed the Jacques Beauchamp-Molson Trophy earlier in the day as the Canadiens’ “unsung hero” this season, previously suited up for the Buffalo Sabres and Calgary Flames before being claimed off waivers in early October.

26 – Number of games Brian Flynn missed with a lower-body injury before returning to the Canadiens’ lineup on Saturday night against the Lightning.

4 – Numbers of players who played all 82 games for the Canadiens during the 2015-16 campaign, including Alex Galchenyuk, Tomas Plekanec, Max Pacioretty and Andrei Markov.

303 – Number of shots on goal Max Pacioretty managed to register this season, good for third spot in the NHL behind just Alex Ovechkin and Brent Burns.

3 – Number of consecutive seasons in which Brendan Gallagher has reached the 20-assist plateau, accomplishing that feat once again on Saturday night by feeding Alex Galchenyuk for the game’s opening goal.

14 – Percentage of the goals the Canadiens have scored this season that have come off the stick of Alex Galchenyuk, with No. 27 adding to that tally with his 29th goal of the season during the opening frame before scoring his 30th goal of the season in the middle period.

20 – Spot Tomas Plekanec now occupies on the Canadiens’ all-time goal scoring list after notching his 14th goal of the season - and 216th tally of his career - on Saturday night, pushing him past both Elmer Lach and Ralph Backstrom in the process.

0 – Number of fights Paul Byron had registered on his NHL resume before dropping the gloves with Lightning forward Vladislav Namestnikov during the second period on Saturday night.

423 – Number of assists defenseman Andrei Markov has collected over the course of his NHL career, adding another two helpers to his resume on Saturday night to surpass Maurice Richard (421) and take sole possession of eighth place on the Canadiens’ all-time assist list.

15 – Number of multi-point games Max Pacioretty has registered during the 2015-16 campaign, including Saturday night's tilt against the Lightning. Pacioretty is ahead of Alex Galchenyuk (12) in that department, with both players putting their names on the scoresheet more than once in the Canadiens' regular-season finale.

57 – Number of days that have elapsed since Alex Galchenyuk celebrated his 22nd birthday, with the Canadiens' sniper becoming the third-youngest player in team history to reach the 30-goal plateau in a single season behind Stephane Richer and Bernard Geoffrion who did it at the age of 21.

         <title>Paul Byron voted the 2015-16 Jacques Beauchamp-Molson Trophy recipient</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877886</link>
         <description>PRESS RELEASE

MONTREAL - Members of the media assigned to the Montreal Canadiens voted forward Paul Byron as the 2015-16 recipient of the Jacques Beauchamp-Molson Trophy. The trophy is awarded annually to the member of the Canadiens who played a dominant role during the regular season, without earning any particular honor. Byron succeeds forward Dale Weise who earned the award in 2014-15. 

Byron received the most votes in the race for the Jacques Beauchamp-Molson Trophy, earning 122 points in the overall standings ahead of goaltender Mike Condon (118 points) and forward Torrey Mitchell (25 points).  

In his first season with the Canadiens, Byron set career highs in goals (11) and games played (61) since the beginning of the 2015-16 season. The 5'8'', 158-lbs forward collected seven assists for a total of 18 points, six penalty minutes and two game-winning goals. He ranks second on the team (first among forwards) with 112 hits. The Ottawa native is tied for sixth in the league (with seven other players) with three shorthanded goals and ranks tied for fifth in the NHL (with two other skaters) with five shorthanded points. 

Created in 1981 to honor the memory of the legendary sportswriter who spent most of his professional career covering the Canadiens, the Jacques Beauchamp-Molson Trophy was first awarded to Doug Jarvis following the 1981-82 season.</description>

         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (37-38-6) vs. Lightning (46-30-5)

TV: TVAS, SN 7:00 p.m.

The Habs welcome the Lightning to the Bell Centre for the final game of the 2015-16 regular season.  

In rookie netminder Charlie Lindgren’s first career NHL start on Thursday night in Raleigh, the Canadiens twice overcame leads by the Carolina Hurricanes to give their young goaltender his first career NHL victory. The 4-2 final score in favor of the Habs was ignited by blue-liner Darren Dietz’s first career NHL goal, which got the Habs on the board with just 10 seconds left in the first period. 

At the Prudential Center in New Jersey, Jonathan Drouin – who was just recently recalled from Syracuse of the AHL on April 6 – scored the game-winning-goal in his first game with Tampa Bay since December 30, 2015. Netminder Ben Bishop stopped 20 of the 22 shots fired his way on Thursday night to lead the Lightning to a 4-2 victory over the Devils. 

Following Thursday night’s road victory in Raleigh, coach Therrien gave his troops the day off of practice on Friday.

After being sidelined with a lower-body injury for the last two months, Brian Flynn will return to the Canadiens' lineup on Saturday night. He will likely play on a line with Torrey Mitchell and Paul Byron. Mike Condon, meanwhile, will get the start in goal.

The Canadiens will attempt to go for the season-series sweep of the Lighting in Saturday night’s regular season finale, having come away victorious in all three match-ups between the two rivals thus far this campaign.</description>

         <description>RALEIGH -- The Canadiens kept their promise to Charlie Lindgren on Thursday.

Pregame, Brendan Gallagher’s vow was clear: “We’re going to do everything we can to make sure it’s a positive night for him.”

And true to their word, the entire team pitched in to help the 22-year-old earn his first NHL win in his first NHL start.

“I thought that was the best game our young D core has played. With recoveries, it seemed like if someone got beat, their defensive partner would bail them out with good sticks,” underlined captain Max Pacioretty, who picked up a goal and an assist in the 4-2 effort. “We were bailing each other out mostly in the back, and it could have been that everybody wanted to get the win for Lindy.”

With most of his family in attendance, the Lakeville, MN native was appreciative of the support on his memorable 26-save night.

“A lot of credit goes to the team in front of me -- them blocking shots and grabbing sticks -- they played a fabulous game in front of me,” acknowledged Lindgren, whose first NHL start initially began with his first NHL goal-against on his first NHL shot faced. “There were definitely some nerves there, I’m not going to lie about it. I just tried to be as calm as possible after that first goal went in. I really wasn’t rattled, I put it behind me and focused on the next shot.”

That cool and calm demeanor came just as advertised for head coach Michel Therrien.

“His competitiveness is one of the reasons our scouts liked him,” revealed the Canadiens bench boss, who started a fifth goaltender this season for the first time since 2001-02. “He wasn’t affected [by that early goal]. In fact, it made him bounce back in the right way.”

Added Pacioretty: “He played well and made some big saves late. I think that says a lot about his mentality and the type of player he is.”

As special as the evening was for the first-time NHLer, Darren Dietz also enjoyed a night to remember in Raleigh, scoring his first goal with the Canadiens in just his 12th game, to tie things up at 1-1 with 10 seconds left in the opening frame.

“It’s a great experience. It’s something that you dream about as a kid, so it was a special moment,” admitted the Medicine Hat, AB native, even if he stressed that his teammates did all of the heavy lifting.

“I saw Patch and Gally attacking with the puck, and when those two have it, special things happen pretty often. I just tried to make myself available and those two have a real knack for getting the puck to the open guy. After I got it, it was just a matter of getting the puck on net.”

In fact, Dietz insisted he already has some points he’d like to work on in the next one, partially shouldering the blame for the game’s opening goal.

“I need to do a better job on the one-on-one battles. The plays start in the corners, so I felt I owed him that one.”

Even if that were true, you can bet Thursday’s winning goaltender won’t be holding a grudge any time soon.

“Two weeks ago I wouldn’t have expected to be here right now. Two weeks ago I was playing for St. Cloud State and now I just got my first NHL win. It’s unbelievable,” concluded Lindgren. “I don’t think it’s fully sunk in yet.”

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877655</link>
         <description>RALEIGH - Here's a numerical look at Thursday night's game on the road against the Carolina Hurricanes.

14 -- Numbers of years which have passed since five different Canadiens goaltenders have appeared in at least one game in a single season. Charlie Lindgren became the fifth of the current campaign, joining Carey Price, Mike Condon, Dustin Tokarski, and Ben Scrivens in that capacity. Prior to Thursday night, the last time it happened was in 2001-02, when José Théodore, Jeff Hackett, Mathieu Garon, Stéphane Fiset and Olivier Michaud also divvied up the work five ways.

41 -- Number of away games in an NHL campaign. The Canadiens hit the road for the final time this season on Thursday, and now get set to host their home finale at the Bell Centre opposite the Lightning on Saturday.

31 -- Number of cities the Canadiens travelled to in 2015-16. In addition to the usual 29 other destinations across the League, the Habs also brought NHL hockey back to Quebec City during the preseason, as well as visited Foxboro, MA on New Year’s Day for the 2016 Winter Classic.

32 -- Number of points earned by the Canadiens’ leading scorer on the road this season, captain Max Pacioretty, who racked up 12 goals and 20 assists over 41 games -- including one of each on Thursday.

14 -- Number of multi-point games Pacioretty has enjoyed this season, following Thursday’s action.

12 -- Number of games it took Darren Dietz to score his first career NHL goal, beating Cam Ward to tie the game at 1-1 with 10 seconds to go in the first.

93 -- Number of days separating Daniel Carr’s last two goals. The 24 year-old scored for the first time on Thursday after returning from an injury which kept him sidelined from late January to April 2.

         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (36-38-6) vs. Hurricanes (35-29-16)

TV: RDS, SNE 7:00 p.m.

The Habs head to Raleigh, North Carolina for the team’s final road-trip of the 2015-16 regular season. 

A night of firsts on Tuesday evening at the Bell Centre featured John Scott’s first match in a Montreal Canadiens jersey and rookie defenseman Ryan Johnston’s first career game in the NHL. Alex Galchenyuk scored the lone goal for the Habs in the 4-1 loss, which puts him in sole possession of the team lead in goals with 28.  

Meanwhile, on Tuesday night in Boston, the Hurricanes and Bruins required a five-round shootout to settle the score. Rookie Noah Hanifin’s shootout winning goal would give the Hurricanes a 2-1 road victory and would give Cam Ward his 23rd victory on the season. 

Following Wednesday’s skate in Brossard, coach Michel Therrien confirmed that 22-year-old netminder Charlie Lindgren will suit up for his first career NHL start in goal on against the Hurricanes.

With regards to injury updates, the Canadiens organization announced on Wednesday morning that Carey Price, P.K. Subban, Mark Barberio, Victor Bartley and Lucas Lessio will not return to action this season. And in terms of lineup changes, Mike Brown will be back in the coach Therrien's formations on Thursday, while Stefan Matteau and Brian Flynn will be the night’s scratches.

With the season series deadlocked at one game apiece, Thursday night’s winner will own bragging rights heading into 2016-17.</description>

         <title>Safety first</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877502</link>
         <description>MONTREAL – The Canadiens weren’t about to take any chances with Carey Price or P.K. Subban with just two games remaining in the regular season.

On Wednesday morning, the team announced that both players wouldn’t see game action for the rest of the year as they continue to recover from their respective injuries. In addition, Mark Barberio, Victor Bartley and Lucas Lessio were also ruled out for the final two games of the season.

After months of speculation, it was revealed that Price had sustained an MCL sprain to his right knee back in late November in a game against the New York Rangers. Subban, meanwhile, has missed the last 12 games after suffering a neck injury on March 10 against the Buffalo Sabres.

Both players met with members of the media on Wednesday to discuss their health status and shed some light on the progress they’ve made since being forced to watch from the sidelines.

“[The decision] was made last night. During this whole process, it was my goal to get back and play game minutes. I just kind of ran out of time. Last night, we made the decision that if it wasn’t going to be possible to go back in there being 100 percent, then there was no point in risking it,” offered Price, who played just 12 games during the 2015-16 campaign, posting a 10-2-0 record, a 2.34 goals-against average and a .934 save percentage before being placed on injured reserve.

When the injury occurred, it was believed that Price would miss a minimum of six weeks. Unfortunately, the nature of the injury mandated a lot more recovery time, which wasn’t easy for the Canadiens’ No. 31 to swallow. Eager to return and help his teammates through their struggles, Price admits it’s been a trying few months taking in games from afar.

“I came in and did my work every day and did everything I could to get back. I just fell short of getting back by a couple of weeks. It was a frustrating process. It was definitely the most challenging year of my career,” admitted Price, who still fully expects to be ready for training camp and the World Cup of Hockey come September. “Obviously, it didn’t turn out the way we wanted it to. Collectively, as a group, we’re obviously disappointed in the results.”

Head coach Michel Therrien felt especially bad for Price given the time and effort he’s put in to try to get back between the pipes before the season was officially done.

“Right up until the last minute, we hoped that he’d be able to play a game. But, in the end, he simply wasn’t going to be ready in time to do it. That was really frustrating for everyone,” said Therrien, who confirmed that newcomer Charlie Lindgren would make his NHL debut on Thursday night in Carolina, while Mike Condon would close out the year on Saturday night against Tampa Bay.

When he hasn’t been rehabbing at the Bell Sports Complex, Price has been spending plenty of quality time with his wife, Angela, who is due with the couple’s first child in just two-and-a-half weeks. That’s really been the bright spot for the nine-year NHL veteran throughout his recovery.

“One thing I was able to be blessed with was being able to spend time with my wife during our first pregnancy. I think that was probably the biggest thing that helped along the way. We’re kind of at the end, at the boiling point right now,” shared Price. “This is going to be a special moment in our life. I’d like to be able to spend it at home and be with my wife.”

Like Price, Subban was equally disappointed with the way things played out with his recovery efforts, which simply weren’t completed in time to return to active duty.

“I’m disappointed, but I also have to be thankful that I’ve gone through six seasons in the NHL without missing a game until this year. I can’t be too negative. The positive thing is that it’s not a career-threatening injury, it’s just something that needs to take time,” said Subban, who surpassed the 50-point mark for the third consecutive year in 2015-16, picking up 51 points in 68 games.

“I wanted to play the next game on the Saturday after being taken out on a stretcher. That’s the mentality [I have]. I’ve played pretty much my whole career in games where I was injured. You still find a way to play, but in this case, when it’s your neck, it’s a little bit different,” added Subban, who confirmed that his symptoms related to the injury haven’t subsided just yet.

In short, the Canadiens were never going to put either player in a position where they could hurt themselves even further by coming back too early. It wasn’t worth the risk.

“The safety and security of our players has always been very important,” concluded Therrien. “When a player doesn’t feel ready to come back, the medical team simply won’t give them the green light.”

         <title>Medical update - Carey Price not to return to action this season</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877397</link>
         <description>PRESS RELEASE

MONTREAL – Canadiens’ general manager Marc Bergevin announced Tuesday that goaltender Carey Price will not return to action this season. The decision was made last night by the Canadiens’ medical staff, head team physician Vincent Lacroix, head orthopedic surgeon Paul Martineau, with Marc Bergevin and Carey Price.

“Now that Carey Price’s season has officially ended, here is a detailed description of his injury: Carey sustained a medial collateral ligament injury (MCL sprain) to his right knee on November 25th, 2015 in a game against the NY Rangers. The MCL provides support to the inside of the knee and is essential for stability and knee function. Acute, isolated MCL injuries are managed without surgery. Rehabilitation treatments lead to full functional recovery. The recovery process can be long in the case of an elite netminder such as Carey, due to the high demand placed on this anatomical structure by modern goaltending techniques. Although Carey has made excellent progress and is very close to being able to return to competition, he has not presently been cleared to do so. He is expected to make a full recovery over the off-season. This injury was not the same as the one he suffered earlier this season (October 29th at Edmonton), nor in previous years,” said the Canadiens’ head physician, Dr. Vincent Lacroix.

The Canadiens also announced that the following players will also be out for the remainder of the season due to injuries: P.K. Subban (neck), Mark Barberio (concussion), Victor Bartley (groin/broken foot) and Lucas Lessio (right knee).</description>

         <title>Max Pacioretty voted by his teammates as the Canadiens nominee for the 2015-16 King Clancy Award</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877399</link>
         <description>PRESS RELEASE

MONTREAL – The Montreal Canadiens announced on Wednesday that forward Max Pacioretty was selected by his teammates as the team’s nominee for the 2015-16 King Clancy Memorial Trophy. In 2014-15, the Canadiens candidate for this honour was goaltender Carey Price.
 
Max Pacioretty, 26, was drafted by the Canadiens and spent his entire NHL career in the organization. On September 18, 2015, the New Canaan, Connecticut native became the 29th captain in team history following a vote among his teammates. This honour is a tribute to his leadership skills on the team. 

In 2011, following his recovery from a severe concussion and broken vertebra during a hockey game that sidelined him for several games, Max Pacioretty teamed up with the Montreal General Hospital Foundation to establish the Max Pacioretty Foundation to support the traumatic brain injury project and help purchase a state-of-the-art advanced High Performance MRI machine for the Hospital, with the objective of raising $3.5 million.

Each donation through the Montreal General Hospital Foundation is personally recognized by Max Pacioretty. Over and above his personal commitment to his foundation, Max generously contributed to fundraising efforts of the Montreal Canadiens Children’s Foundation and took an active part in the team’s various charitable endeavours.  

The Montreal Canadiens captain will now compete with the nominees of the 29 other NHL clubs for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy.

Since it was first introduced back in 1988, the King Clancy Memorial Trophy is presented annually to the player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and has made a noteworthy humanitarian contribution in his community. The nominee is selected from each NHL club by a vote of his fellow players and the final selection is made by a special panel of judges consisting of members of the PHWA and hockey broadcasters at the end of the NHL regular season. The King Clancy Memorial Trophy was presented to the NHL by its board of directors in honour of the late Francis M. “King” Clancy. 

Since the King Clancy Memorial Trophy was introduced almost three decades ago, only one representative of the Montreal Canadiens was awarded the trophy, Saku Koivu in 2006-07.</description>

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877267</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - John Scott’s 2015-16 season was more than just long and arduous, it was the kind of stuff that Hollywood movies are made of -- literally. 

Back when the calendars still read 2015, a social media campaign aimed at pushing an unlikely Scott to the forefront of the All-Star fan vote gained unexpected traction. In a blink of an eye - on the heels of a surprising trade to Montreal from the Arizona Coyotes – the St. John’s IceCaps 6’’8 left-winger was suddenly thrust into the spotlight of the NHL’s All-Star weekend in Nashville, Tennessee. 

After the veteran scrapper left Nashville with the All-Star Game MVP honors, one thing was clear; a stage was set for a Hollywood movie chronicling Scott’s life, all it needed was an ending.

On Tuesday evening the Montreal Canadiens organization helped pen the final chapters of the Scott saga by rewarding the lighthearted, team-first veteran with an opportunity to lace up his skates for a game against the Florida Panthers in front an excited Bell Centre crowd.

“It would have been nice to have gone out with a win. But I was mostly just hoping for a good crowd and a good atmosphere and the fans certainly didn’t disappoint. I had a lot fun out there,” confirmed an emotional Scott, who was treated to a resounding applause when his name was surprisingly announced in the starting lineup. “I was surprised to find out that I was in the starting lineup. That was a nice gesture. That’s just what this organization here in Montreal is all about. It is a classy organization and I don’t deserve any of this. To put me out there for the starting lineup, that was really, really nice. I wasn’t expecting any of that to happen.”

For the fans that are less familiar with the fearless enforcer’s story, you might be surprised to hear that Scott’s first hockey fight didn’t come until he reached the age of 23; which is much later in comparison to his peers in the fist-throwing fraternity. 

As the players in the Canadiens room would attest, Scott is the kind of player who wears his heart on a sleeve. That genuine characteristic was quite evident on the eight-year NHL veteran’s face as he passionately addressed the media in Montreal for perhaps the final time.
  
“It’s a fairly emotional moment for me right now. I don’t know what’s going to happen next and it’s very emotional. You are always aware of the fans during an NHL game. You can hear the crowd, especially in this building. The fans in Montreal are always loud and they pay close attention to the games. It’s nice to be acknowledged by the crowd for making a good play. 
You feed off that as a player and I can’t imagine playing 82 games here. It is just such a good atmosphere in this building,” admired the 33-year-old, who approached tonight’s game with the same professionalism he showed throughout all of the adversity thrown his way this season. “You never know what’s coming next. That could have been my last game. It’s an emotional experience so you try to block all of that out until after the game. Now I just have to move on and deal with it.”

According to bench boss Michel Therrien, the Habs organization wanted to reward the deserving gentlemen - who has handled an otherwise difficult situation with nothing but pure class - with the chance to potentially close out his career with a storied NHL franchise like the Montreal Canadiens. 

“Ever since he first joined our organization he’s been nothing but a real pro. He was great with the young kids over in St. John’s. It’s been a unique season for him as we all know and we wanted to do the right thing. We wanted to give him the opportunity to start and to finish the game on the ice.  Tonight was special for John, so we wanted to therefore make sure that we handled tonight the right way. It was an emotional day for him. I have to thank the fans for their support tonight; they were really supportive of him all evening,” noted coach Therrien, who rewarded the Edmonton, Alberta native with a season-high 9:01 of ice-time. 

“Marc [Bergevin] also met him after the game to offer him the chance to end his season a bit early in order to get back home. It’s been two months since he’s been able to really go home and see his wife and his young children. His family means the world to him so we wanted to make sure he was given the opportunity to go home after all of this.”

When Scott does finally make it back home, he will have a handful of new pieces to add to his memorabilia collection, a year’s worth of text messages from friends and family, and one heck of a story to tell.

         <title>The Numbers Game: April 5, 2016</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877266</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - Here's a numerical look at Tuesday night's game against the Florida Panthers.

96 - Number of days since John Scott’s last NHL game, which occurred when the veteran was still a member of the Arizona Coyotes back on New Year ’s Eve against the Winnipeg Jets. In the 96 days since that late December night, Scott has appeared in 27 games with the St. John’s IceCaps where he picked up four goals and 85 penalty minutes.

1 – The number of players in Montreal Canadiens franchise history that have sported the number 89, as the Habs newest blue-liner Ryan Johnston made Habs history by donning a number that has never been worn, a feat that is particularly hard to replicate on a franchise with as much history as the Canadiens. 

15 – The number of different blue-liners iced by the Canadiens during the 2015-16 campaign, as the Habs newest arrival Ryan Johnston added his name to a list that includes Andrei Markov, P.K. Subban, Nathan Beaulieu, Jeff Petry, Alexei Emelin, Tom Gilbert, Greg Pateryn Mark Barberio, Jarred Tinordi, Victor Bartley, Morgan Ellis,  Darren Dietz, Joel Hanley et Brett Lernout. 

999 – The number of games that Habs rookie Ryan Johnston needs to play in order to match Florida Panthers defenseman Brian Campbell, who suited up for his 1,000th career game on Tuesday night at the Bell Centre. The Sudbury, Ontario native is on the right path as he now has 1 career game to his credit. 

6 – The number of pucks fired on net by Habs tenacious forward Brendan Gallagher in just the first period alone, as the 23-year-old added another shot in the final 40 minutes to eclipse his previous career high of seven shots in one game. 

28 – The number of goals scored by Alex Galchenyuk, who entered Tuesday night’s contest tied neck-and-neck with Max Pacioretty for the team lead in goals with 27 markers this season. Which means Galchenyuk’s second period power play goal gives him sole possession of the team lead in goals with 28.

11 – The number of points amassed by sniper Alex Galchenyuk in the span of his last eleven games played on home ice in front of the Bell Centre faithful. The Habs leading goal scorer maintained his recent point-per-home-game average by thwarting Panthers netminder Roberto Luongo on the power play in the second period.

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens vs. Panthers</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877211</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (36-37-6) vs. Panthers (45-25-9)

TV: RDS, SNE 7:30 p.m.

The Habs get a shot at payback for Saturday’s 4-3 loss in Sunrise, as they welcome the Panthers to the Bell Centre on Tuesday night. 

On Saturday night in Sunrise, the Canadiens built a three-goal lead only to watch the Panthers storm back to score four unanswered goals to win 4-3. Brendan Gallagher scored his 19th goal of the season in his return to the lineup from a lower-body injury. While netminder Mike Condon kicked aside 35 of the 39 shots he faced in the losing effort. 

The Panthers meanwhile head to Montreal following a 4-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leaf, extending their win streak to three games.

As Al Montoya got the nod against the Maple Leafs on Monday night, Montreal, Quebec native Roberto Luongo is expected to return to the blue paint at the Bell Centre. Luongo holds a 13-14-4 record in 35 career starts against his hometown team. 

Between the pipes, the Habs 25-year-old rookie netminder will be called upon to start his career high 54th game of the season. 

With regards to lineup changes, recent call-up John Scott will hit the ice for his first game in a Canadiens jersey on home ice against Florida. In addition, rookie defenseman Ryan Johnston will be suiting up for his first career NHL game. As a result, Stefan Matteau and Mike Brown will sit out Tuesday night’s clash as healthy scratches. 

While the Habs sported a sparkling 4-0-1 record in the season series against the Panthers in 2014-15, Florida has come away victorious in all three previous match-ups between the two teams this year.</description>

         <title>IceCaps report – April 5</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877115</link>
         <description>The Montreal Canadiens have a new farm team this season, the St. John's IceCaps. To help Canadiens fans track the team's performance in the AHL, we have invited Charles Dart, website contributor of the IceCaps' official website to prepare a bi-weekly summary of the action in Newfoundland.

ST. JOHN’S – As the cliché goes, “like father, like son”. Unfortunately for both the parent Canadiens and affiliate IceCaps, the playoff dream for this season has officially ended. 

With a 4-1 loss on Friday, April 1st versus the Philadelphia Flyers farm team, the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, the St. John’s IceCaps were mathematically eliminated from Calder Cup contention. 

The IceCaps followed up with a 4-0 loss to the Phantoms on Saturday in what was Ben Scrivens’ first AHL game since December 20th, 2015. 

Head coach Sylvain Lefebvre and his team returned to the Rock on March 30th after their longest road trip (seven games) of the season. The club went 2-5-0 in action versus the Utica Comets, Syracuse Crunch, Rochester Americans and Toronto Marlies.

“It’s a tough weekend,” said Lefebvre after Saturday’s match. “It’s tough to come back from a long road trip like this and play right away. I could feel that the guys didn’t have any energy.”

Lefebvre has had to juggle a combination of returning, new, and departing players within a consistently changing lineup night in and night out, especially as of late. 

“We’re going to have some new faces coming in from junior and we’ll see what we’re going to do with our roster this week.” 

Less than 48 hours later it was announced that Daniel Audette and Jeremiah Addison were added to the IceCaps mix after their respective junior teams were eliminated from further playoff action. 

Other first year players have also been signed of the course of the past two weeks as well.

Forward Cory Ward and defencemen Tom Parisi and Chris Joyaux were signed to Amateur Tryout Contracts (ATO) after finishing their collegiate hockey careers. 

Parisi signed a two-year (two-way) deal with the Canadiens and attended the Habs development camp in July 2015. 

Ward completed his career with Bemidji State University in Minnesota while Joyaux is coming off his career with Miami University in Ohio.

With the multitude of player recalls to Montreal, the IceCaps defensive corps is down to three players from the season opening roster. However, the IceCaps are fully loaded on the front end with 17 forwards and with the influx of forward players, Shane Bakker and Andrew Yogan were released from the PTO contracts.

Out of the 26 players on the active roster, 17 are in their first season of pro hockey. 

The IceCaps have just four games left on tap for the season, all of which will be played at Mile One Centre.

Bud Holloway is four points shy of his personal best 61-point AHL campaign set back in 2010-2011, and is just two points shy from tying the IceCaps single season record of 59. Holloway is eight in AHL league scoring.

Captain Gabriel Dumont surpassed his personal best of 45 points set last season. He sits at 46 points, one goal shy of another personal best of 20 goals.</description>

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=877104</link>
         <description>BROSSARD – John Scott couldn’t stop smiling during his first practice with the Canadiens on Monday.

Recalled from the AHL’s St. John’s IceCaps over the weekend, Scott skated alongside his teammates at the Bell Sports Complex in preparation for his debut with Michel Therrien’s troops come Tuesday night against the Florida Panthers in Montreal. Featured on a line with Paul Byron and Torrey Mitchell, Scott enjoyed every single minute of the on-ice session.

“Obviously, I’m excited that they called me on Sunday night and said to get ready to be called up to the team. Any chance you get to put on the jersey of an Original Six team is pretty exciting, so it was a good call. It was actually the assistant GM of the IceCaps, Vincent Riendeau, who called me,” said Scott, who was acquired in a three-team trade with the Arizona Coyotes and Nashville Predators back in mid-January, and has been plying his trade with the IceCaps ever since.

According to Scott, it was Marc Bergevin who approached him last week to see if he’d be interested in a one-game stint with the big club. The 33-year-old jumped at the idea after playing 27 games with Sylvain Lefebvre’s squad and putting up two goals, four points and 85 penalty minutes along the way.

“It’s kind of cool how everything’s come full-circle. It’s good to be back in [an NHL] room. I haven’t met most of the guys yet. Half of the team I met in St. John’s, though. It’s good to be up here and kind of experience what it’s like to be a Canadien,” said Scott, who hasn’t played an NHL game since New Year’s Eve when he still called the Valley of the Sun his hockey home. “They’re kind of doing me a favor. It’s a one-game thing, unless I go out and score a hat trick.”

That being said, the past three months haven’t been easy for Scott, particularly with the events that transpired leading up to the NHL All-Star Game in Nashville in January. Despite being voted in as the Pacific Division captain by way of a fan vote, his attendance was up in the air when he was dealt to the Canadiens and re-assigned to the IceCaps. In the end, however, everything worked out just fine and Scott went on to steal the show in Music City and claim MVP honors in front of a raucous crowd at Bridgestone Arena.

Nevertheless, he still had to come to terms with plying his trade in the AHL ranks for the first time since the 2008-09 campaign, which was a tough pill to swallow following previous big league stops in Minnesota, Chicago, New York, Buffalo, San Jose and Arizona.

“It’s never easy to kind of get demoted from your job. I’ve been in the NHL for eight years now. It was a tough transition,” admitted Scott, who says the IceCaps’ personnel really facilitated the move and helped ease the adjustment along. “The group down in St. John’s really helped me, the coaches and the management staff. They took baby steps with me and let me work my way through it. I’ve had fun down there and it’s been a good experience. It’s good to be back [in the NHL], but I’ll be happy to go back to St. John’s, too.”

Scott’s former teammate with the Sharks last season, Mike Brown, insists the towering forward is a welcome addition in the Canadiens’ dressing room.

“It’s always nice to have a big body on the ice. Everyone plays a little bigger when he’s out there and it’s good to have him on our side,” said Brown, who, like Scott, doesn’t shy away from playing a physical brand of hockey and is always willing to defend his teammates. “He’s a great guy in the room. He’s already making us laugh, so John’s a good presence to have around the group.”

Needless to say, Scott is going to soak everything in during his stay with the Canadiens and appreciate every single shift on Tuesday night. It’s an experience he’s been eagerly anticipating for quite some time.

“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play for the Canadiens, such a cool franchise. I’m really excited to be here. It’s nice to be back. It’s nice to be around the guys. I’ll have fun [playing against Florida],” said Scott, who has 285 games of NHL experience on his resume. “I would love to come and play here and I appreciate everything they’re doing for me right now.”

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=876841</link>
         <description>SUNRISE – Despite building a three-goal cushion early on, the Habs weren’t able to stop the Panthers' top line on Saturday night. 

MOVES LIKE JAGR/BARKOV/HUBERDEAU: After spotting their visitors a 3-0 lead by the mid-way point in the second period, the Panthers managed to spring into attack mode buoyed by their top line, including a four-point effort by 20-year-old center Aleksander Barkov. Sitting among the 25 leading point-getters in the league one month after celebrating his 44th birthday, Jaromir Jagr sparked the rally with his 26th of the campaign, before Barkov and Jonathan Huberdeau completed the comeback in the final 20:04. The trio has now combined for 11 points in three games against the Canadiens this year, including eight from Barkov, five from Huberdeau, and three from Jagr. 

“They’re good. We’ve played against good players before, but it seems like every time we play them, that line finds ways to contribute. It’s two pretty young kids playing with Jagr. I’m sure they’re learning a lot from him,” mentioned Brendan Gallagher, who was matched against the Panthers’ snipers for the majority of Saturday’s game. “They’re definitely a challenging line to play against, but at the same time you can’t be happy when you give a line that much success.”

TOP THREE: Saturday night provided a sneak peek at what could be the Canadiens’ top line for the foreseeable future. Michel Therrien’s first look at a potential combo that saw Gallagher and Max Pacioretty flanking newly-minted NHL centerman Alex Galchenyuk didn’t last long. After suffering a lower body injury just 4:52 into his night on March 5, Gallagher was forced to miss the following 12 games before finally making his return to action on Saturday in Sunrise. While he joked on Friday that his goal was to just try not to mess with a good thing after seeing Pacioretty and Galchenyuk combine for 22 points in his absence, his concerns were assuaged pretty quickly following the opening puck drop. It didn’t take long for the trio to find chemistry, with Gallagher chipping a shot from the slot over Roberto Luongo on his third shift of the night.  
 
“The training staff do a good job of making sure that when you’re out there, you’re in good shape and ready to go. I wouldn’t have come back if I didn’t feel like I could contribute,” stressed Gallagher, who had five shots in his 21:43 of ice time and is now one goal shy of potting his 20th of the season. “We felt good, but I thought we probably should be scoring a couple more, especially in a game we lost by one goal. It didn’t really take long for us to feel good playing with each other, it’s just a matter of us finishing them off, especially with the couple of chances late. We did a good job creating scoring chances. It’s just disappointing. When you get up 3-0 on the road, you have to find ways to win those hockey games.”

MORE PATIENTS: The parade to the Canadiens’ clinic continued on Saturday as the team was forced to finish with five defensemen for a second-straight game when Brett Lernout had his night end early after suffering a lower body injury. Lernout, who was called up on Friday to replace Nathan Beaulieu in the lineup after the latter suffered a season-ending broken thumb in Tampa, played just 6:30 in his NHL debut before being tended to by the team’s medical staff. Greg Pateryn also missed some action against the Panthers after taking a puck to the cheek in the second period, but the 25-year-old was able to return to action a few minutes later, playing 21:43 on the night. Three blue-liners played over 20 minutes against the Panthers, including Pateryn, Andrei Markov (27:17), and Alexei Emelin (26:10) and rookie rearguards Joel Hanley (19:52) and Darren Dietz (17:30) both enjoyed the most action of their young careers to date.  

“Losing another defenseman was definitely taxing on our group. Everything was under control, but with the loss of Lernout and then Pateryn for a short time, we asked a lot of our defensemen,” admitted Therrien, who has seen 14 different blue-liners play at least one game for the Canadiens this season.  “Even our veterans like Markov and Emelin played way too many minutes. We lost some energy because of that. Tonight’s circumstances made things a little more difficult, for sure. 

“[P.K.] Subban plays big minutes,” added Therrien, whose injured Norris Trophy-winning defenseman averages 26:21 of ice time per game, good enough for sixth in the league in that category. “In the situation we’re in right now, we don’t have a lot of experienced guys who can play those kinds of minutes.”

The Canadiens won’t have to wait long for a rematch, with their next game against the Panthers scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday night in Montreal.

         <description>SUNRISE - Here's a numerical look at Saturday night's road game against the Florida Panthers.

9 – Number of players in uniform for the Canadiens on Saturday night who were not yet born when Panthers forward Jaromir Jagr played his first career NHL game, on October 6, 1990. 

26.57 – Average age of the current Canadiens roster, making the Habs the sixth-youngest team in the NHL behind the Oilers, Hurricanes, Sabres, Jets, and Blue Jackets. 

10 – Number of players who have worn No. 36 in Canadiens history, with Brett Lernout becoming the first to don the digits since Matt D’Agostini when he made his Habs debut on Saturday night. 

8 – Number of Habs players who have participated in the first game of their respective NHL careers this season, with Lernout joining Michael McCarron, Daniel Carr, Darren Dietz, Bud Holloway, Charles Hudon, Joel Hanley, Morgan Ellis, and Mike Condon on the list of Canadiens who have made their big league debuts in 2015-16. 

6:30 – Amount of ice time enjoyed by Lernout in his inaugural game before seeing his night come to an early end after suffering a lower body injury in the second period.

3 – Number of shifts needed by Gallagher to make his presence felt on the scoresheet, potting his 19th goal of the campaign midway through the first period. 

6 – Number of assists racked up by Hanley in seven career NHL games to date, picking up a helper on Gallagher’s opening goal to bring him to six since making the jump to the bigs. 

11 – Number of goals scored by both David Desharnais and Torrey Mitchell this season, each potting goals in a second-straight game on Saturday after both finding the back of the net in Tampa on Thursday night. 

1 – Number of times Mitchell has scored 11 or more goals in a season in his eight NHL seasons, setting a new career-high in that category by lighting the lamp against the Panthers. 
    
116:53 – Amount of time Mike Condon spent between the pipes without letting anything past him in the past two games, finally seeing Jagr snap his shutout streak in the second period after recording his first career whitewash in Tampa.

         <description>MONTREAL – Being traded to the Canadiens in late February caught Phillip Danault by surprise, but shock quickly gave way to incredible pride and excitement.

After all, the 23-year-old was coming back to ply his trade on home soil where he’d enjoyed so much success in his native Victoriaville throughout his four-year QMJHL career that also included a brief stop in Moncton, NB.

He’d also be surrounded by his family and friends on a full-time basis for the first time since joining the Chicago Blackhawks’ AHL affiliate in Rockford, IL for the duration of the 2013-14 campaign once his playing days in “The Q” were done.

Having that support system really eased Danault’s transition back home along following an extended stay in the Prairie State that wrapped up just five weeks ago.

“They’ve been great for me. My father, [Alain], my mother, [Michelle] and my sister [Ann-Andree], have always been there through everything – all the games and tournaments. My girlfriend, too. It’s amazing. I’m sure they really love what’s happening right now with me being back home. We’re a really close family, so it’s great to have their support. I think it’s the most important thing in the world,” said Danault, who was selected 26th overall by the Blackhawks back in 2011.

“I always have people coming to the Bell Centre for games from Victoriaville and other cities close by to Montreal. It’s nice. I’m not paying for every single ticket, though. That would eat up my entire paycheck,” added the Canadiens’ No. 24 with a laugh. “But, I can’t thank them all enough for their help. They’re all so important. They’ve helped me stay humble and calm after the move.”

Family and friends aside, Danault was also reunited with Marc Bergevin, who had just been promoted to assistant general manager in Chicago just over a week before the Blackhawks made the Junior standout their second pick in the opening round of the NHL Draft in Minnesota. The fact that Bergevin sought out his services in exchange for Dale Weise and Tomas Fleischmann certainly wasn’t lost on Danault once the deal was done.

“It’s a special relationship Marc and I have. I know he’s the guy who really pushed to draft me as a first-rounder. He really wanted me. He really believed in me and my capacity to be a solid two-way player at center or on the wing. It’s an honour to play for him now that I’m in the NHL. When a GM trusts you like that, it’s very big. Mentally, it’s huge. I’m glad he was able to get me. It’s a big sign of respect,” said Danault, who credits Bergevin with helping him along early on in the Blackhawks organization before taking the job in Montreal in May 2012.

“I was only 18 when I got to Chicago. He was the guy who really helped me the most. He told me to text him if I needed anything at all. Once he left, I wanted to stay in touch with him, but it was tough with him being with another team. Now, we’re together. I knew he wanted to get me again, I just didn’t know when. It was a great feeling when it happened,” continued Danault, who has three goals and five points in 17 games since debuting with the Canadiens on February 27.

To say that Danault is committed to proving Bergevin right for bringing him on board would be an understatement. He arrived in Montreal eager to put the lessons learned in Rockford and Chicago alike to good use all season long, especially come playoff time. While the Canadiens won’t be playing postseason hockey this year, when they do manage to get there again, Danault will be ready and willing to chip in.

“I haven’t played in the [NHL] playoffs yet, but being with the Black Aces for the Stanley Cup run last year taught me a lot. Most importantly, you learn how to win. Seeing guys like [Jonathan] Toews and [Duncan] Keith battle like that teaches you that it’s never over in the playoffs. You’re never out of it. I’m just trying to follow the path they took there in Chicago and bring it here,” said Danault, a key contributor to the IceHogs’ first playoff series win since 2007-08 last season in a three-game sweep over the Texas Stars in round one. “It was one of the best times of my life. I didn’t win the Cup, but I was there on the ice with the guys at the United Center last June. I got a taste of it a little bit. That made me hungrier than ever to get it myself. I want to lift it one day. It’s a big dream.”

Two months after celebrating the Blackhawks’ sixth Stanley Cup title in franchise history – and their third triumph in the last five years – Danault elected to go under the knife in New York City to repair a torn labrum in his left hip. That sidelined him until early December, when he finally returned to Rockford’s lineup before being called up to join Joel Quenneville’s contingent for the long haul after centerman Marcus Kruger went down with a wrist injury.

That marked the start of Danault’s first real stint in the NHL ranks – and he hasn’t played an AHL game since. He’ll always be grateful to the Blackhawks for affording him the opportunity to be an NHL regular, and he’s committed to maintaining that same status and being a productive member of the Canadiens for years to come.

“I’m proud to be here. I watched the Canadiens growing up, and my father took me to my first NHL game at the Bell Centre when I was 10. It’s an honour to be here and to wear that crest on my chest. It’s a big accomplishment,” concluded Danault, a life-long fan of Saku Koivu for his skill, determination and courage to overcome adversity. “But, it’s just the start of something. I want to do bigger things with this group. I’ve got to keep going. This is a great opportunity for me to show what I can do.”

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens vs. Panthers</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=876688</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (36-36-6) vs. Panthers (43-25-9)

TV: TVAS, SN 7:00 p.m.

The Habs take on the Panthers at the BB&amp;T Center just three days before they welcome Florida to the Bell Centre in a series of back-to-back games between the two Atlantic Division combatants. 

On Thursday night in Tampa Bay, rookie netminder Mike Condon earned his first career NHL shutout with a 26-save performance against the Lightning. David Desharnais and Torrey Mitchell both scored their 10th markers of the season lifting the Habs to a convincing 3-0 victory. Coach Michel Therrien has confirmed that Condon will get a chance to extend his shutout streak on Saturday night in Sunrise.   

On the other side of the ice, the Panthers are fresh off a 3-2 take down of the New Jersey Devils on home ice on Thursday night. Jonathan Huberdeau found the back of the net twice, while Al Montoya kicked aside 23 of the 25 shots he faced to earn his 11th victory of the season. 
As Montoya got the nod against New Jersey, expect Montreal, Quebec native Roberto Luongo to return to the crease to face the Canadiens. Luongo holds a 12-14-4 record in 34 career starts against his hometown team. 

In the injury department, Brendan Gallagher slotted in on a line completed by Alex Galchenyuk and Max Pacioretty at Friday morning’s practice. Following the team skate, the Habs tenacious forward confirmed he will be back in the lineup to face the Panthers on Saturday night. 

Furthermore emergency recall Brett Lernout will take Nathan Beaulieu’s spot in the lineup as the Habs blue-liner suffered a season-ending broken thumb on Thursday night. Meanwhile, Daniel Carr makes his return to the lineup jumping onto Michael McCarron’s left-wing opposite Phillip Danault. As a result, Stefan Matteau, Mike Brown and Jacob de la Rose (injured) will not suit up  

The Panthers jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the season series, but the Habs have two remaining games left to even the score.</description>

         <title>Florida Notebook – April 1</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=876645</link>
         <description>SUNRISE – Injury updates galore, new faces in the lineup, and more in Friday’s notebook from South Florida. 

BACK IN THE SADDLE: After missing the past 12 games with a lower body injury, Brendan Gallagher will make his return to action on Saturday night in Florida. Having previously missed six weeks earlier in the season with a pair of broken fingers, the gritty winger admits he’s had his fill of quality time in the team’s clinic in 2015-16. Despite having suited up for just 49 games this year, the 23-year-old has racked up an impressive 18 goals and 35 points – numbers he’ll have a chance to build on while skating on the team’s top line alongside Alex Galchenyuk and Max Pacioretty for the final four games of the campaign. 

“In our first game together, I got hurt, so hopefully we’ll be able to stay together for a little while now. They’ve been playing really good hockey so I’ll come in and try not to mess that up,” joked Gallagher, whose linemates have amassed a combined 22 points since their right-winger was injured on March 5. “We’ll just go out there and have some fun and work as hard as we can. There are four games left so there’s still time to play some good hockey and come back and contribute.”

MEDIC ALERT: To say the Canadiens have been hit hard with injuries this season would be an understatement. With just shy of 350 man games lost to injury in 2015-16, the Habs are among the Top 5 teams in the league in that dubious category. The clinic clients continued to pile up on Thursday night when Nathan Beaulieu saw his season come to an early end after suffering a broken thumb against the Lightning. With Beaulieu on the shelf, the Habs have recalled Brett Lernout from the IceCaps, making him the 17th player called up from St. John’s this season. When one player goes down, it’s an opportunity for others to step up, and Max Pacioretty has been impressed with what he’s seen from some of the rookie blue-liners who have made the jump this year, particularly Joel Hanley, who now has five assists in six career NHL games.  

“He’s got composure and that’s important as a D man,” praised the Habs’ captain. “Rather than just shovel it up the wall, he’s been making plays and that makes it a lot easier on the wingers. Sometimes when a D comes up, they’re scared to make plays and they end up rimming it or high flipping it. [Joel] has composure back there and that makes it a lot easier on the wingers. 

“Obviously it was tough to see a guy go down last game, especially a guy who could benefit from playing big minutes and someone who was playing well and eating lots of minutes and gaining confidence,” he added on Beaulieu. “That’s the way the season has gone and we can’t get frustrated. When guys come back we have to make sure we build on our game. We see a bright future so we have to make sure we play the right way and have the right mindset to build a winning culture.”

THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT: Despite being in just his second full season in the NHL, Beaulieu, with his 151 career NHL games played, was one of the most experienced players on the team’s blue line against Tampa. While Andrei Markov (924) and Alexei Emelin (300) are seasoned vets on the back end, the other four rearguards who will be in the lineup against the Panthers count a combined 69 games of NHL experience under their collective belts, and three have fewer than 10 games played on their career stats lines. After shutting down the Lightning on Thursday night even with just five defensemen in the lineup for the final 40 minutes, Markov has been impressed with what he’s seen from his green blue line of late.

“I don’t think they have any pressure right now. For sure they’re nervous, but with our situation, for them it’s probably a good time to play,” he explained. “All they have to do is just play their game and stick to the system and have fun. They’ve been good.”

PRICE WATCH: Out of commission with a lower body injury since November 25, Carey Price has participated in full practices with his teammates for the past two days. The reigning Vezina, Jennings, Ted Lindsay, and Hart Trophy winner would love to be between the pipes in Sunrise, but while he continues inching closer to making his return, for now he’s just happy to be back on the ice with the boys. 

“Having your teammates there is the biggest thing. There’s nothing like going out onto the ice and having all your buddies pushing you. It’s really hard to do that by yourself,” admitted the 28-year-old netminder, who was named to Canada’s World Cup roster in early March. “You can train all you want by yourself, but when you have those other guys there pushing you to be better and you have good coaching, it makes it that much easier. 

“I’d like to play tomorrow, but I don’t have a set time to come back yet. Every day, I come in and see how I feel. I feel like it’s more of a day-to-day thing now,” explained Price, who mentioned that he has yet to regain his full range of motion and is still looking to perfect his timing on the ice. “I’ve been working this whole time to get back and that’s always been my goal. If that happens, it’s great, but if it doesn’t, I’ll be ready in September. I’m just going to keep pushing forward and keep working to get back in there.”

         <description>TAMPA – Mike Condon had a milestone night in Tampa. 

Facing a team with the potential to crack the 100-point benchmark down the stretch, the Habs knew they wouldn’t be in for an easy night against the Lightning. Despite sitting on the outside of the playoff picture looking in and icing a lineup consisting of seven NHL rookies and just eight players who were on the ice for the team on opening night, the Canadiens stormed into Florida and came away with a 3-0 win.

While the Habs were able to light the lamp three times against the league’s fourth-stingiest team, it was their work at the other end of the ice that sealed the Canadiens’ third win in the last five games. Earning his first career NHL shutout with a 26-save performance in Tampa, Mike Condon crossed another item off his rookie year To Do list in Tampa. 

“It’s a special feeling. It took me 48 tries, but better late than never,” joked the 25-year-old netminder, who also registered his 20th win of the campaign on Thursday night. “I’m very happy it got done, but I’m happier about the win. Two in a row. I haven’t done that in a while, so it feels pretty good.”

Forced to play with just five defensemen after Nathan Beaulieu suffered a season-ending broken thumb in the first period, the team’s blue-liners didn’t slow down in their efforts to help Condon earn his first big league whitewash. In addition to chipping in on offense, with Alexei Emelin and Greg Pateryn picking up a combined three assists, the rearguards were even more impressive in their own end, not allowing a single shot on goal in the final 12:28 of action – something that didn’t go unnoticed by the first-year netminder. 

“They played five D when Beau got hurt and four when Dieter [Darren Dietz] got in that fight,” mentioned Condon, who was asked if he planned on buying his blue-liners dinner as a thank you.  “At the end of the year, I think that’s something all goalies should do, take their D out for dinner, much like quarterbacks take their linemen out for dinner. I owe those guys everything. They’re sacrificing their bodies and blocking shots wearing a lot less equipment than I do. They’re very tough.”

Condon may be a little too quick to deflect all the credit for his first shutout. Not only did he shut down one of the NHL’s leading snipers in Steven Stamkos, who had four shots on the night, he also stoned Ondrej Palat on a second-period penalty shot attempt to maintain a two-goal lead heading into the final frame.

“Scoring chances weren’t that high compared to most nights. There was that penalty shot there, but the guys kept most shots to the outside and cleared out the rebounds,” countered Condon. “There were only two or three of those [high quality scoring chances] if I remember well. That’s a manageable night in the NHL.

“I just like winning. I think most goalies and most players like winning; it’s not about the personal accomplishments,” he stressed. “Sometimes you happen to get a shutout, but it was a huge win and I’m just happy to get the 20th.”

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=876447</link>
         <description>TAMPA - Here's a numerical look at Thursday night's game against the Lightning in Tampa.

400 – Number of NHL games played by David Desharnais in his career to date, accounting for 8.3 percent of the combined experience in the Canadiens’ lineup on Thursday night when he hit the milestone against the Lightning. 

42 – Number of defensemen in Canadiens history who have played 300 or more games with the team, a list that now includes Alexei Emelin after the Russian blue-liner suited up for career game No. 300 on Thursday night. 

10 – Number of Habs players who have scored 10 or more goals this season, with Desharnais and Torrey Mitchell both hitting double digits with goals against the Lightning. 

5 – Consecutive number of seasons in which Desharnais has hit the 10-goal plateau after pouncing on a first-period rebound against the Lightning. 

3 – Number of times Sven Andrighetto has registered points in three consecutive games in his young career so far, picking up an assist on Desharnais’ goal to record his fourth point in a three-game span.

9 – Number of shifts played by Nathan Beaulieu in the game, seeing his night come to an early end after suffering an upper-body injury in the first period. 

2 – Number of times Mitchell has scored 10 goals in a season, tying the career-high he set in his rookie season in San Jose on Thursday with his 10th goal of the 2015-16 campaign. 

1 – Number of times Darren Dietz has dropped the gloves in the NHL, squaring off with Jonathan Marchessault in the second period for his first career NHL fight. 

532 – Number of days since Alexei Emelin last enjoyed a multi-point game, picking up two assists on Thursday for the first time since October 16, 2014, to bring him to 11 points on the current season.

         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (35-36-6) vs. Tampa Bay (44-27-5)

TV: RDS, SNE 7:30 p.m.

The Habs make their final trip to Tampa Bay where a Thursday night match-up against the Lightning awaits them at Amalie Arena. 

A two goal night from captain Max Pacioretty helped lead the Canadiens to a 4-3 victory over Detroit on home ice at the Bell Centre on Tuesday night. Mike Condon had a busy night, kicking aside 39 of the 42 shots he faced to earn his 19th victory of his rookie season.  

After a 5-2 loss to the Panthers snapped Tampa Bay’s four-game win streak, the Lightning got back to the win column with a 3-0 shutout over the Toronto Maple Leafs. Sniper Steven Stamkos extended his personal scoring streak to six games with a two-point effort against Toronto, bringing his totals to 64 points in 76 games. 

Coach Michel Therrien named Mike Condon as Thursday night's starter, while newly acquired goaltender Charlie Lindgren, who the Canadiens signed to a two-year contract on Wednesday morning, accompanied the team to Florida. The rookie will sport No. 35.

Between the pipes for Tampa Bay, Ben Bishop’s 34-save shutout over the Maple Leafs could earn him the start against the Canadiens. The 6-foot-7 netminder sports a 10-2-3 record in 15 career starts against Montreal. 

In the injury department, P.K. Subban, Brendan Gallagher, Brian Flynn, Daniel Carr and Carey Price hit the road with the team to Tampa Bay. All players were accounted for at Thursday's morning skate, including Price, who suited up for his first team practice since suffering a lower-body injury earlier this season. Lastly with regards to lineup changes, Stefan Matteau will take Mike Brown's spot in coach Therrien's formations. 

The two teams are set to meet one last time as the Canadiens close out their regular-season with a clash against the Lightning on April 9 at the Bell Centre.</description>

         <description>MONTREAL – Tom Parisi is ready to embark on the next stage of his hockey career.

Just hours after the 22-year-old defenseman and his fellow Providence College Friars were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament in the Regional Finals in Worcester, MA, Parisi agreed to terms on a two-year, two-way contract (2016-17 and 2017-18) with the Canadiens on Saturday afternoon – in addition to a 25-game amateur tryout deal with the AHL’s St. John’s IceCaps – that will keep him plying his trade with Sylvain Lefebvre’s contingent through the end of the season.

It’s an opportunity for the Commack, NY native to get his first taste of the pro ranks coming off a productive four-year stint in Rhode Island that included helping the Friars claim their first NCAA title in school history last season.

“It’s a dream come true. The past four years have been an unbelievable ride. We’ve been able to accomplish so many different things together in Providence. But, to be able to take the next step, especially with such a storied franchise behind me like the Montreal Canadiens, is really special. I’m so excited to get the ball rolling,” said Parisi, who joined the IceCaps on Monday in Toronto and made his pro debut on Tuesday night against the Marlies.

The 5-foot-11 and 195-pound rearguard attended the Canadiens’ Development Camp last July on a try-out basis, which means he’s already familiar with Lefebvre and other members of the IceCaps’ coaching staff. Given the steep learning curve that awaits him in the coming months, that can only help to ease Parisi’s transition along as he works to take his game to new heights in Newfoundland.

“Playing in St. John’s is going to be a tremendous experience and I’m going to do everything I can to make a good first impression. I was around the staff last summer in Brossard, but to really get to know them and have them teach me more about the areas I have to work on going forward is huge. It’s also a good chance to get used to my new home,” said Parisi, who put up 12 goals, 55 points and a plus-46 differential in 144 regular season games on the Friars’ blue line.

Veteran Friars bench boss Nate Leaman says Parisi certainly has the tools to one day earn his place on an NHL roster. His skating ability is particularly strong, according to Leaman, as is his ability to transition the play up the ice.

“Tom’s skating is pretty dynamic. He can beat guys with his first step. He can really explode with the puck up the ice. He’s a guy who’s going to get you out of your zone and get the forwards the puck when they have speed. He’s got good poise with the puck and great decision-making skills on breakouts. I think that’s what makes him very good at his job,” explained Leaman, who made Parisi one of two captains with the Friars in 2015-16, along with fellow senior Kevin Rooney.

“You love to coach kids who come to the rink every single day and show up and work hard. They want to be there and they want to get better. Those are the guys that you look back on and really respect as a coach. Tom is one of those guys who responded and did everything we asked of him in every facet on and off the ice. He was an outstanding representative,” added Leaman, who also coaches goaltending prospect Hayden Hawkey in Providence, and used to mentor Habs young gun Daniel Carr during his freshman campaign at Union College in 2010-11.

Likewise, Parisi credits Leaman with providing him with the right kind of guidance to one day make his NHL dreams a reality.

“He just kind of developed me in the later part of my career as a college player to be ready to contribute at the next level. He pushed me hard, making sure to get the best out of me. In the end, I think it worked out for the both of us,” said Parisi, who will graduate with a finance degree on May 15. “Wearing a letter meant so much because I worked so hard from the moment I set foot on campus. Coach Leaman and my teammates put so much faith in me. We’ve had a great relationship.”

Going undrafted, says Parisi, really was a blessing a disguise. It afforded him the opportunity to grow both academically and athletically at an institution that boasts a solid reputation in the classroom and a winning culture on the ice, one that includes three straight trips to the NCAA Tournament. Fortunately, Parisi got to experience it all.

“I was kind of a late bloomer, to be honest. The fact that I wasn’t drafted gave me more motivation to work harder because in life there isn’t anybody pushing you harder than yourself. If anything, it was extra motivation to prove people wrong and make them realize that they made a mistake. I just tried to focus on what I could control and get better every day I was at the rink,” said Parisi, who scored two of the biggest goals in program history last season, notching the game-winning goal against the University of Denver in the East Regional, before scoring the game-tying marker in a 4-3 come-from-behind win over Boston University in the NCAA championship game.

A fan of the New York Rangers and Hall-of-Famer Brian Leetch growing up on Long Island, Parisi has been paying close attention to the way a pair of Canadiens blue-liners have been going about their business for years. Both P.K. Subban and Andrei Markov have been role models for the IceCaps’ No. 5, who really is on cloud nine these days.

“P.K. is such a great skater and playmaker. I’ve watched Markov pretty closely over the last couple of years. He’s a very smart player. He always makes the right decisions. I can learn something from each of them,” concluded Parisi. “This is just an opportunity. I want to be the best player I can be. I want to attain the highest level. I just want to prove what I can do.”

         <title>Canadiens agree to terms on a two-year contract with free agent Charlie Lindgren</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=876237</link>
         <description>PRESS RELEASE

MONTRÉAL – Montreal Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin announced today that the team has agreed to terms on a two-year, two-way contract (2015-16 and 2016-17) with free agent goaltender Charlie Lindgren.

“We are very happy to have reached an agreement with Charlie Lindgren. Lindgren was in our mind one of the best free agent goaltenders available coming out of the US college level. He made the decision to join the Canadiens organization and will complete the season with the team. Lindgren is a top goaltender coming out of college, and becomes an excellent prospect for our organization, bringing some depth at this position,” said general manager Marc Bergevin.

Lindgren, 22, appeared in 40 games with the St. Cloud State Huskies (NCHC) in 2015-16, posting a record of 30 wins, 9 losses and one draw. He led all NCHC goaltenders in wins (30), saves (1,020) and shutouts (5 – tied with two other goaltenders). Lindgren ranked second in the NCHC in minutes played (2,343), third in save percentage (.925) and fourth in goals against average (2.13).

Lindgren played in 88 regular season games at St. Cloud State in three complete seasons since making his college debut in 2013-14, posting a 51-29-3 record with eight shutouts. The 6’02’’ and 190 lbs goaltender displayed a 2.21 goals against average and a .921 save percentage.

A native of Lakeville, Minnesota, Lindgren suited up with the Sioux Falls Stampede (USHL) in 2011-12 and 2012-13, posting a 44-33-5 record, with two shutouts, a 3.00 goals against average and a .903 save percentage.</description>

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=876012</link>
         <description>MONTREAL – The Canadiens got things done the hard way on Tuesday night at the Bell Centre.

After going up 2-0 on the Detroit Red Wings through 20 minutes of play on goals by Max Pacioretty and Paul Byron, Michel Therrien’s troops surrendered three straight power play goals during a wild second period to find themselves down a goal heading into the final frame.

That’s when they mustered the collective strength to turn the tables on a Red Wings squad in the midst of a heated playoff race with just a handful of games remaining on the schedule.

Sven Andrighetto’s seventh goal of the season tied things up, before Pacioretty’s second tally of the night – and 27th of the year – with 8:42 remaining in regulation time ultimately proved to be the game-winner and secured a 4-3 triumph.

“That was a dogfight. You go up two and you have to kill off a certain amount of penalties there. They’ve got so much skill over there, throwing pucks at the net. They’re so dangerous and so fast, and they come with a lot of speed. We battled hard,” said goaltender Mike Condon, who made 39 saves on Tuesday night, including 23 stops in the third period alone to keep Detroit off the scoresheet when it mattered most. “I thought Jimmy Howard played really well, and it was a really tough game.”

Howard was forced into action after starter Petr Mrazek surrendered the opening two goals of the game on just seven shots against. The line of Pacioretty, Byron and Alex Galchenyuk gave both Red Wings netminders fits, accounting for three of the Canadiens’ four goals on the night, including the decisive marker.

“They’re elite talents in this league. It’s a real opportunity to play with those two guys. You go to the net, you work hard, and you get rewarded with a goal,” praised Byron, who scored his second goal against the Red Wings in the last six days dating back to their previous meeting in Michigan last Thursday. “I’m a fast guy. I can get in the corners and dig pucks out for them. I can really use my speed to jump in and transition with them. I was a skill guy all through Juniors and in the American Hockey League, so I think I complement them a little bit.”

For his part, the Canadiens’ captain firmly believed that if his squad managed to maintain their focus after a tumultuous second period, they still gave themselves a chance to spoil things for their Atlantic Division counterparts as they try to secure a playoff berth for the 25th straight season.

“I thought we dominated them 5-on-5. Obviously, we allowed some goals on the power play, so we had to keep our composure a little bit better. We knew that if we stayed out of the box in the third, we had a chance. We got rewarded in the end,” explained Pacioretty, who was visibly pleased with the final result, especially given the way things seemingly got out of control in the middle period while the Canadiens found themselves in penalty trouble.

Byron shared similar thoughts in the aftermath of the Canadiens’ 21st victory of the year on home turf.

“This team preaches hard work, compete and 60-minute efforts. We knew we had to redeem ourselves after Saturday. It doesn’t matter what the score is, what time of the game it is, this team is going to work for 60 minutes,” concluded Byron. “We might not always have our best hockey, but part of our identity and our culture here is we compete and we work hard. That’s a 60-minute game for us.”

         <title>The Numbers Game: March 29, 2016</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=876010</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - Here's a numerical look at Tuesday night's game against the Red Wings in Montreal.

100 – Number of consecutive games Alex Galchenyuk has suited up for with the Canadiens, including Tuesday night’s tilt against the Detroit Red Wings at the Bell Centre. Galchenyuk last missed a game on February 21, 2015.

5 – Red Wings forward Anthony Mantha played his first career NHL game in Montreal on Tuesday night, going up against the club his grandfather André Pronovost played for during five seasons between 1956 and 1961.

7 – Number of shots the Canadiens fired in Red Wings goaltender Petr Mrazek’s direction before he was replaced by Jimmy Howard at the 11:25 mark of the opening frame. Mrazek had given up two goals by then, with markers coming courtesy of Max Pacioretty and Paul Byron.

5 – In his fifth game since being recalled from the AHL’s St. John’s IceCaps, defenseman Joel Hanley registered his fifth point, blasting the point shot that Pacioretty re-directed past Mrazek in the first period for his 26th goal of the year.

2 – Number of goals Paul Byron has scored over the last six days against the Red Wings, picking up right where he left off last Thursday night in Michigan with his 11th goal of the year.

27 – Number of penalty minutes that the referees handed out to Alexei Emelin and Justin Abdelkader during the second period following the Russian rearguard’s hard hit on Red Wings young gun Dylan Larkin. Emelin was given 10 minutes in penalties (5 for interference and 5 for fighting), while Abdelkader was given 17 (5 for fighting, 2 for instigating and a 10-minute misconduct).

44 – Number of seconds that elapsed in the second period between goals by Gustav Nyquist (12:33) and Mantha (13:17) that let the visitors tie things up 2-2, before Mike Green gave Detroit the lead with their third power play marker of the frame.

3 – Sven Andrighetto finished Tuesday night’s contest with a goal and an assist, his third multi-point game of the 2015-16 campaign and his first since March 8 against the Dallas Stars.

4 – Number of multi-goal games Pacioretty has registered this season, adding to that tally by scoring twice on Tuesday night against Detroit. It's the Canadiens captain's first multi-goal effort since February 27 against the Toronto Maple Leafs.

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens vs. Red Wings</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875908</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (34-36-6) vs. Red Wings (38-27-11)

TV: RDS, SNE 7:30 p.m.

The Habs and Red Wings meet for the 2nd time in six days, as the Canadiens look to avenge last Thursday’s 4-3 loss in Detroit. 

In the Canadiens most recent game on Saturday night at the Bell Centre, a five-goal second period - in which the Rangers would light the lamp four times – gave New York all they would need on route to a 5-2 victory. Lars Eller and Phillip Danault combined to solve netminder Antti Raanta twice in the loss. 

The Red Wings meanwhile arrive in Montreal after hosting a Monday night contest against the Buffalo Sabres at the Joe Louis Arena. Though the Sabres would score twice in the last two minutes, Detroit managed to hold on to secure a crucial two points in the standings to pull even with Philadelphia for the 8th and final spot in the Eastern Conference. 

As Jimmy Howard got the start last night against the Sabres, expect Petr Mrázek to return to the blue paint for Detroit. The young netminder picked up the victory when the two teams last met on March 24, 2016, making 26 saves along the way.

In the injury department, P.K. Subban continues to await the doctor’s green light, Daniel Carr participated in Monday morning’s practice, albeit in a non-contact jersey. In addition, Brendan Gallagher is nearing his return to the lineup and will travel with the team to Florida later this week. 

With regards to lineup changes, Jacob de la Rose will take Stefan Matteau's spot in Michel Therrien's formations, while Mike Condon will get the nod in goal. The first-year netminder was recently named the team’s candidate for the 2015-16 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy as the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. 

Last Thursday’s victory gave the Red Wings a 2-1 edge in the season series, meaning Tuesday night presents Montreal’s last chance to even the score.</description>

         <title>Putting in the work</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875868</link>
         <description>BROSSARD -- Mike Condon was honored by the media on Monday, but won the respect of his teammates long ago.

The first-year netminder was named the team’s candidate for the 2015-16 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy by the Montreal chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers Association as the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.

Only five Canadiens players have ever been awarded the trophy, but there’s no question in the Habs’ most recent winner’s mind that Condon has been a poster boy for those exact attributes.

“Condo was obviously put into a very tough situation, so it’s a huge testament to his character,” expressed captain Max Pacioretty, who took home the honor in 2011-12. “He’s a guy who doesn’t get comfortable or rest on past accomplishments. He’s at the rink every day working very hard on getting better and taking care of his body, and I think that’s a big reason why he’s made it this far.”

Pacioretty won the award in his comeback season from a fractured vertebra suffered on March 8, 2011, and was quick to underline just how much the recognition represents.

“It meant a lot to me because I think people were questioning how I’d come back from my injury,” acknowledged the team’s leading point-getter. “For me, it was probably my biggest accomplishment in hockey so far, but I credit everybody in my corner, whether it be family or trainers or the friends who helped motivate me to come back better. I think it’s a character trophy more than anything.”

In Condon’s case, it was an injury to starting goaltender Carey Price that forced the 25-year-old to show his resolve. After Price was sidelined for the first time on November 1, Condon stepped in and continued to ride an early season point-streak to the tune of a 7-1-2 record in his first ten NHL games. He’s since gone 18-23-6 with a 2.72 goals against average and 0.902 save percentage, and leads all rookie goaltenders in wins (18), saves (1,181) and minutes played (2,826).

“You don’t replace Carey Price, it’s impossible. All we can do is make sure we show up prepared to play our best and work our hardest,” continued Pacioretty. “I think that’s why guys have respected Condo right from the start -- they’d see him at the rink on off-days working hard, or in the trainer’s room making sure he was as good as he could be out there. Guys who have that kind of preparation get a lot of respect.”

Indeed, that respect was voiced from every corner of the dressing room on Monday.

“He’s had a lot on his plate this year. He’s probably never been in a situation like this where he’s had to play this many games, but he’s done everything we could have asked of him. He’s come in with the right attitude, and he’s taken a step or two forward in his career this year. There shouldn’t be any fingers pointed at him,” underlined Lars Eller. “From what I’ve seen from Mike this year, I think he has a very good head on his shoulders. All the things you want to see from a rookie, a new guy, or a young player -- he’s given us.”

Added assistant captain Tomas Plekanec; “He’s been great for us, especially when he jumped in after Carey got hurt at the beginning of the season. He played really well for us, and he’s a great guy to have on the team as a backup goalie. He’s been doing a great job.”

For the man himself, the experience has predictably been a moving on.

“I’m not really expecting many awards this year, but it’s an honor to be nominated,” admitted Condon following Monday’s practice. “You see names on the wall like Saku Koivu and Max Pacioretty, guys who went through a lot more difficult times than I did with their respective health concerns, while I’m just doing my job and playing hockey. It’s nice to get that recognition, but it’s not what I’m after, and it’s not what we’re trying to do as a team. I’m not a guy who likes the spotlight or the attention, so it’s just very humbling.”

But not exactly unexpected given the Holliston, MA native’s approach to business.

“Whenever you come into a new locker room, whether you’re traded or called up, or it’s your first time with a team, you’ve always got to earn the respect of your coaches, teammates, and all the staff. That’s a responsibility everyone has, so that’s what I’ve tried to do,” added Condon, who was signed by the Canadiens as an undrafted free agent in 2013. “I’ve tried to keep my mouth shut as much as possible, and work my hardest.”

Monday’s nomination is just the latest memorable moment in a season which has been full of them for Condon, including making his NHL debut, a father-son road trip in November, and playing near his hometown in Foxboro before a massive crowd at the Winter Classic on January 1. Still, true to himself, the former Princeton product is not ready to bask in the accolades just yet.

“Once the season’s over I’ll have a lot of memories that I’ll be able to look back on, but right now we’ve still got a couple of game left and we want to finish strong,” concluded Condon. “We’re professionals, and we want to win every game we play. Wearing this jersey is something special, at least for me it is. Every game you get in this league, in my eyes is a blessing and a gift. You’ve got to respect that and go out there and prepare and perform like it’s your last.”

         <title>Mike Condon is the Montreal Canadiens candidate for the Bill Masterton Trophy in 2015-16</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875814</link>
         <description>PRESS RELEASE

MONTREAL - The Montreal chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers Association (PHWA) announced today the selection of Montreal Canadiens’ goaltender Mike Condon as the team’s candidate for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for the 2015-16 season. Canadiens’ defenseman Andrei Markov was the team nominee for the 2014-15 season.

The 25-year old Condon is completing his first NHL season. Throughout the season, he has been a true example of sportsmanship, perseverance and determination. Signed as an undrafted free agent by the Canadiens on May 8, 2013, Condon perfected his skills in the ECHL and the AHL for three seasons before making the jump to the NHL this season. 

The Holliston, Massachussetts native displays an 18-23-6 record, with a 2.72 goals against average and a .902 save percentage in 50 games, including 46 starts this season. Condon leads all NHL rookie goaltenders in wins (18), saves (1,181) and minutes (2,826).

The Canadiens’ goaltender will now be in contention with the league’s 29 other nominees for this coveted award.

The Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy is awarded to the NHL player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. The winner is selected by a poll among the 30 chapters of the PHWA at the end of the regular season. The trophy commemorates the late Bill Masterton, a player with the Minnesota North Stars, who lost his life following an NHL game on January 15, 1968.

Five Canadiens players have been awarded with the Masterton in league history; Max Pacioretty (2011-12), Saku Koivu (2001-02), Serge Savard (1978-79), Henri Richard (1973-74) and Claude Provost (1967-68), who became the first recipient of the award.</description>

         <title>A complicated second</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875627</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - Regardless of where the Canadiens are currently situated in the standings, there is still very much on the line for the players in the dressing room.

On Saturday night at the Bell Centre, the Rangers jumped out to an early lead thanks to J.T. Miller’s 21st goal of the season, but the Canadiens answered in kind with a first period marker of their own in the form of a laser of a wrist shot off the stick of Lars Eller. 

However, if Saturday’s tilt against New York appeared to be a close contest, the second period would unfortunately prove otherwise for the Canadiens.

For just 1:32 into the second period, Hull, QC native Derick Brassard would put the Rangers back on top. And then, in the blink of an eye – or more accurately two minutes and 45 seconds – Chris Kreider chipped in with another two unanswered goals and suddenly the Rangers held a 4-1 lead. 

“A guy like Chris Kreider is going to win every foot race you give him. But part of that is just knowing the players in the league and knowing who you are on the ice against. We just have to be a bit smarter and do a better job at recognizing which lines we are up against when we are on the ice,” began Max Pacioretty, whose 55 points in 76 games is good for the top spot on the Canadiens scoring list this season. “We made some good plays but it’s the costly mistakes that keep hurting us. We’ve been competitive in each game we play but NHL teams are just too good not to take advantage of mistakes.”

Although Phillip Danault’s late second-period goal momentarily breathed some life back into the Canadiens, Derek Stepan’s goal with just 41 seconds remaining would prove to be backbreaking. When the Habs returned to the ice for the third period, they had lost not only the momentum of the game but their starting goaltender as well, as rookie netminder Mike Condon was relieved by veteran Ben Scrivens to start the final frame. 

“We’re all in this together. We support Mike [Condon], he obviously just wants to win just like we all do. He wants to play well but I think we all have a lot to prove. We gave up too many dangerous chances tonight. It’s on everybody,” expressed Pacioretty, who was quick to deflect any blame away from his netminder, while simultaneously pointing out that the Habs offense should have found a way to solve netminder Antti Raanta in the opposite goal.  

“Raanta was good but given the amount of power plays we had we needed to find a way to score. I think we had a couple grade ‘A’ chances we just couldn’t get the puck to bounce our way. We have to execute better. Good players want to be difference makers. They want the puck on their stick. Getting scoring chances isn’t enough.”

With a three goal lead in hand, the Rangers didn’t look back from their offensive outburst in the second period, holding off a valiant Habs third period comeback to officially knock the Canadiens out of playoff contention. 

“When you give a team like the Rangers that many scoring chances, it can be very hard to find a way to come back and win. If you allow five goals like we did tonight, that means you have to find a way to score six goals and that’s no easy task,” attested the Habs first goal scorer Lars Eller, who entered tonight’s affair with 11 goals and 11 assists to his credit. “We did not play a full sixty minutes tonight; it is as simple as that. There are stretches in the game where we do execute well but there are also times where we repeat mistakes. Against a team like the Red Wings or the Rangers, you have to compete for a full 60 minutes, you aren’t going to win by playing 40 minutes of good hockey.” 

When asked whether it is tough for the players in the room to find the motivation to continue battling when the end-goal of reaching the playoffs is no longer possible, captain Pacioretty didn’t hesitate for a second. 

“You can check every nameplate in this dressing room. Everyone here has something significant to play for.  Whether that means a contract for next year, or trying to stay up with the big club, or trying to solidify your place in the lineup; if you are in the lineup right now you are probably getting your best shot at show what you’ve got,” confirmed the Canadiens captain, who is the only remaining player in the entire NHL to have recorded at least one shot on goal in every single game his team has played so far this season. “If you look back at the Anaheim game for example, you feel like sometimes playoff bound teams can take you lightly. The Rangers took us too lightly in the third period which gave us a chance to comeback, but I think at that point it was already too late.”

Likewise, Phillip Danault’s answer to the very same question left was given unequivocally. 

“Are we excited for the season to end? That kind of sentence needs to be deleted from our vocabulary. This is our sport. In hockey it is normal to experience ups and downs. Our only focus should be on getting right back on the right track.”

51 – Number of career points collected by Lars Eller in games occurring on Saturdays, as the Danish forward added to his totals by lighting the lamp in the first period making Saturday his most productive day of the week, miles ahead of his 31 career points obtained on Tuesdays.  

20 –Phillip Danault’s shooting percentage accrued over his last ten games, as the 23-year-old Victoriaville native found the back of the net with his 1st and 10th shots on goal thanks to his late second period goal against Rangers’ netminder Antti Raanta. 

14 - Number of NHL teams against which David Desharnais has obtained at least 10 career points, as the veteran pivot reached double figures against the Rangers by setting up Phillip Danault’s second period marker on Saturday night at the Bell Centre.

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875558</link>
         <description>PRESS RELEASE

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens vs. Rangers</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875538</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (34-35-6) vs. Rangers (42-24-8)

TV: NHLN-US, TVAS, SN 7:00 p.m.

The Habs welcome the New York Rangers to the Bell Centre for the first time since the home-opener on October 15, 2015.

In the Canadiens most recent game in Detroit on Thursday night, the Habs entered the third period facing a four-goal deficit. A goal from Tomas Plekanec just 47 seconds into the final frame would spark a series of three unanswered goals to pull the Habs within one. Ultimately the Canadiens comeback would come up jus t short as the Red Wings held on to win 4-3. 

The Rangers meanwhile arrive in Montreal on the heels of a 5-2 victory over the Boston Bruins in their last contest. Netminder Henrik Lundqvist turned in a 39-save performance while J.T. Miller chipped in with his 20th goal of the season in the convincing victory. 

Between the pipes, Mike Condon is expected to return to the blue paint after Ben Scrivens turned aside 36 shots in Thursday’s loss to Detroit. The rookie netminder has yet to start a game against the Rangers in his career thus far.

In the injury department, P.K. Subban will not suit up against New York as he continues to await the doctor’s green light. With regards to lineup changes, Mike Brown and Sven Andrighetto will return to the lineup replacing Lucas Lessio and Jacob de la Rose. 

The Canadiens presently hold a 2-0 advantage in the three-game season series between the two combatants this campaign.</description>

         <title>In the spotlight</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875464</link>
         <description>BROSSARD - Typically accustomed to being the center of attention in Montreal, P.K. Subban made a point to start off his post-practice scrum by telling the media gathering that their focus should be on the Montreal Canadiens, not on when he will return to the lineup.

“No I won’t be playing tomorrow.  And just for the record, I will obviously continue to keep skating with my teammates at practice but I think the focus needs to be on the team, not on me. It can’t be about when I’m going to make my return. I don’t even know that myself. I don’t think it’s fair for the rest of the guys to keep asking me when I’m going to come back,” lamented Subban, who patiently awaits the doctor’s green light but has nonetheless been traveling and practicing with the team. “It’s fun to hit the road with the group and be with the guys on the road. They help me out in practice to make sure I get my legs back under me. Conditioning wise I feel amazing.  I just need to continue my treatment and continue getting rest.”

Subban certainly looked like he was back to his old self at Friday morning’s practice in Brossard, entertaining the crowd at the Bell Sports Complex with a thrilling puck handling display through a labyrinth of discarded pucks.  

“In practice nobody is trying to throw any body checks my way. With actual games the biggest difference is giving hits and taking hits which are the most dangerous part of the game. I never put a timetable on my return. During my career I’ve had to play through injuries and play through being banged up. I don’t think you can go six years without any injuries without having to play banged up a bunch of times,” clarified Subban, who continues to play it safe no matter how eager the former Norris Trophy winner is to get back on the ice. “You have to be smart when dealing with certain injuries. In my case it is a matter of not putting me at risk.”

Should the media in Montreal heed Subban’s words, one of the players worth showcasing is rookie defenseman Joel Hanley. In the span of a mere couple of weeks, the 24-year-old defenseman has transitioned from a depth defenseman in the American Hockey League to the leading point-per-game scorer in the entire NHL with an average of 1.33 points per game.

“It’s only three games, but I’m trying to improve every time I hit the ice. I just want to help the team as much as I can. Just play a simple and make smart plays, added Hanley, who stayed humble when asked if he would brag about his NHL leading stat. “No. Some of my friends have sent me some pictures of the points-per-game leader-board. I don’t know if I can brag about it, it’s only been three games. I guess it’s kind of cool. It’s kind of funny.”
Coach Therrien however was happy to brag about his young defenseman. 

“He’s looked good since joining the team. He has great hockey sense and is very composed with the puck. He doesn’t just get rid of it, he makes a good first pass and gets the puck on net. He’s looked very comfortable for a player who just started out in the NHL,” praised Therrien of his young blue-liner, who presently sits ahead of superstars Patrick Kane, Jamie Benn and Sidney Crosby in the points-per-game scoring race. “Seeing as we have four young defensemen with little experience, it can be difficult to shelter them from the tougher assignments. But it is also important for us to see how the young defensemen respond in difficult situations.”

Another youngster who deserves his fair share of the spotlight is rookie Michael McCarron.
On Thursday night in Detroit, the Habs bench boss experimented by placing the 21-year-old on the wing to test the player’s versatility to play multiple positions. Though the Grosse Pointe, Michigan native would have liked to light the lamp in front of a large collection of family and friends, he’s left a strong impression on the Habs brass and the players in the dressing room with his physical and imposing style of play. 

“I don’t think we were connecting in the first period as a team. It was tough for me to establish a rhythm, perhaps because of all the jitters I had playing in front of all the people that came out to support me. I feel comfortable at center. Maybe even more so than wing,” noted McCarron, who continued to take face-offs on his strong side, working in tandem with his new centerman David Desharnais on Thursday night in Detroit. 

As a former first round pick with high expectations himself, Nathan Beaulieu for one has walked in the youngster's (big) shoes. As Beaulieu attests, McCarron’s willingness to pay the price for planting himself in front of the opposing team’s net has not gone unnoticed. 

“He’s done a great job. I think he’s been one of our more consistent players over the last five games. He’s a big guy and he’s playing the style that I think the team is looking for; big and physical. He’s got some finish to his game too, so he’s definitely making an impact on the team so far,” added Beaulieu, who himself just recently returned to the blue-line from an injury sustained in a scary collision with the post on February 22, 2016. “It’s been difficult, the situation were in. It’s a tough part of the year to play in because if you’re not in the playoffs you are fighting for a spot and if you are already out you have to play for pride.”

There might be just seven games left on tap for the Habs this season, but as Subban certified, there's still a dressing room full of interesting stories.

         <description>DETROIT - In Thursday’s post-game notebook, the Canadiens show character in Detroit, Michael McCarron returns home, and Ben Scrivens continues to manage a heavy workload.

DON’T CALL IT A COMEBACK: Trailing the Red Wings 1-0 following the opening 20, the Habs fell behind 4-0 during a tough second period in which the team allowed 21 shots on goal.

But credit the team’s character for not giving up and bouncing back for a strong final frame.

“Nothing special was said after the second period, in this room we just knew we had to be better. We watched them play with the puck for the entire period and it was frustrating,” admitted captain Max Pacioretty, who tallied the third of three goals scored over the period’s opening eight minutes. “If there was a bright spot to this game it’s obviously how we rebounded in the third.”

That character was evident both on and off the scoresheet.

After Stefan Matteau absorbed a solid hit from Brendan Smith which left the forward on the ice for several moments before heading to the dressing room, Phillip Danault nearly dropped the gloves opposite Smith, eventually getting a double-roughing call on the sequence.

“We’ve become a tight-knit group in here, and it shows that our year isn’t over yet. I would have done the same thing for him,” underlined Matteau. “It’s part of the game. I put myself into a vulnerable position and that’s what happened. I don’t blame it on anybody. What’s important is that everything was okay and I was able to return to the ice.”

HOMECOMING: Grosse Pointe, MI native Michael McCarron partook in his first NHL game at Joe Louis Arena on Thursday, with upwards of 40 friends and family members on hand for the occasion.

Despite not getting the desired result in his hometown debut, the contingent of newly converted Habs fans did get their money’s worth with the close, exciting contest.

“I don’t think we got off to the start that we wanted to. The first two periods killed us, but I thought we had a great third. We came back with some jump and made it a tight game,” argued the six-foot-six forward, who had scored his first goal in Montreal just two games prior. “I thought we were connecting on plays, getting the puck deep on the forecheck against their defense, and playing our style of game.”

Still, suiting up for only his 17th game with the Habs, McCarron conceded that there remains an off-ice aspect of his game that requires some work after ending the night a minus-2 with 11:33 of ice time.

“I was nervous. I’ve got to learn how to manage that, and learn how to play in front of lots of family and friends. It was my first time and it was a learning experience for me with those jitters.”

SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS: For a third consecutive game on Thursday, goaltender Ben Scrivens faced at least 40 shots on goal.

Coming off 43 and 44 shot outings in Buffalo and Ottawa respectively, the 29-year-old nevertheless refused place the blame on his teammates for the increased workload.

“That’s definitely an unfair thing to say in a team sport,” stressed Scrivens. “They were getting bounces that we just weren’t. We would try to make a breakout pass and it would hit nothing and explode, going for an icing. It was those weird little anomalies that were the most frustrating.”

But in the end, character nearly prevailed once again.

“Obviously we don’t give up on each other,” concluded the first-year Hab. “We had a tough second period as a group, but we showed some backbone in the third. We came up a bit short in the end, but I think we can all look at the guy next to us and know that he battled. No one packed it in, and that’s an important thing for this group.”

         <description>MONTREAL – Prospects Jake Evans and Hayden Hawkey will have a shot at NCAA glory beginning on Friday afternoon.

Evans – a sophomore at the University Notre Dame – and Hawkey – a freshman at Providence College – will suit up for their respective clubs at the Division I NCAA Tournament that gets underway with regional semi-final action involving 16 teams at four different sites across the United States.
Jake Evans

Notre Dame is the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Regional which will take place at U.S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati, OH. Evans and the Irish will open the single-elimination event against second-seeded Michigan, who is coming into the tournament fresh off securing the Big Ten title last Saturday at the Xcel Energy Center in Minnesota. Puck drop is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. EST.

“It’s really cool. You realize how close you are to winning the whole thing. It’s pretty exciting. It’s do-or-die hockey. This is what everyone plays for, the opportunity to win a championship. Getting there is tough, though. There are so many good teams in this tournament. It’s going to be fun, but it’s going to be a real challenge, too,” said the 19-year-old centerman, who will be making his NCAA Tournament debut against the winningest program in U.S. college hockey history helmed by legendary bench boss Red Berenson.

“Michigan’s got a lot of offense. They’ve got three of the top scorers in the whole country in their lineup [in Kyle Connor, JT Compher and Tyler Motte]. They’re definitely going to be tough to handle because they’re playing with a lot of confidence right now and riding a good winning streak. But, I think if we stick together, stick to our system and focus on defense, we’ll be o.k.,” added Evans, a Toronto native, who finished tied for the team lead in scoring in 2015-16 with 33 points in 36 games – including a team-high 25 assists.

If Notre Dame prevails, they’ll face the winner of the contest between No. 1 seed North Dakota and No. 4 seed Northeastern in the Regional Final on Saturday for the right to head to the Frozen Four at Amalie Arena in Tampa in early April. A tilt against Northeastern would be particularly interesting for the Irish given that the Huskies eliminated them from the Hockey East Tournament with back-to-back wins in the quarterfinals two weeks ago.

Experience, however, has taught Evans that thinking about anything beyond their upcoming opponent isn’t the best way to go about things this time of year.

“Northeastern was unbelievable. They were definitely tough to play against. But, we’ve had a few weeks to refocus and get our game back in order. It’s nice to get a little rest, recover and get ready for our next challenge. I think the biggest thing is just realizing that it’s one game and you’re done. You have to put it all on the line and do whatever it takes to move on,” said Evans, a seventh-round selection of the Canadiens back in 2014.

Hawkey and the reigning national champion Friars, meanwhile, will open up tournament play as the No. 1 seed in the Northeast Regional at the DCU Center in Worcester, MA against the fourth-seeded Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs beginning at 4:30 p.m. EST. The winner will play either No. 2 seeded Boston College or No. 3 seeded Harvard in Saturday’s Regional Final.

“We earned a spot in the tournament, but it’s just the beginning. It’s an exciting time, but we’re not just getting caught up in the excitement of being there. We’re there for a lot more than that,” said Hawkey, who saw limited time between the pipes this season playing behind Junior starter Nick Ellis, amassing a 2-0-0 record, a 1.67 goals-against average and a .940 save percentage in five appearances for Providence. “Duluth is playing their best hockey of the year right now. No matter who we see in the tournament, there’s no bad team or free game. You’re going to have to work for it and earn every inch.”

Last year, Providence claimed its first NCAA title in program history by besting Boston University 4-3 in the Frozen Four championship game at TD Garden in Boston, so head coach Nate Leaman’s troops have a good idea of what it takes to get the job done. While Hawkey didn’t experience claiming the collegiate crown first hand, he’s learned that it all starts with a specific mindset.

“We’ve talked about it all year that we’re not really in the frame of mind of defending it. You can’t take away what those guys accomplished last year. We’re pursuing a new title together. That’s the ultimate goal. We won’t settle for anything less,” said the Friars’ No. 31, whom the Canadiens selected just one pick ahead of Evans in 2014 in Philadelphia. “Having the leaders in this locker room that we have, they’ll make sure of it. They know what it takes to go the distance.”

And, according to the 21-year-old netminder, the Friars are up to the challenge that awaits them in Massachusetts.

“I know we have the group that can do it,” said the Parker, CO native, who, like Evans, should be attending the Canadiens’ Development Camp come July at the Bell Sports Complex in Brossard. “Our job is just to keep improving and adjusting our game every time we play from here on out. We’re at the time of year when one mistake or one little slip can cost you your season. It’s all about consistency in this tournament. You need to be the best for four straight games to take the title.”

         <description>MONTREAL – On Sunday night, defenseman Joel Hanley became the latest player to audition on the Canadiens’ blue line.

Like the proverb says, one man’s misfortune is another man’s gain. That’s been the case for several members of the Canadiens’ defense corps as of late. Since the end of February, four defensemen that were in uniform for the season-opener in October have gone down due to injury at some point in time, including Tom Gilbert, Jeff Petry, Nathan Beaulieu and P.K. Subban. Two others who were called up from the St. John’s IceCaps – Mark Barberio and Victor Bartley –  are now sidelined with injuries of their own. That doesn’t include Darren Dietz, who has been shuffled between the AHL and the NHL twice over the course of the last week.

Several days ago, another soldier added his name to that list when Hanley joined the Canadiens on an emergency recall. After plying his trade on Friday and Saturday in Syracuse with the IceCaps, the 24-year-old defenseman left New York State early Sunday morning, and made the 400-kilometre bus trip to Montreal before suiting up for his first career NHL game that night at the Bell Centre.

Now, with two contests under his belt following Tuesday night’s tilt against the Ducks, Hanley benefitted from a day off on Monday in between outings to reflect on reaching the NHL ranks after essentially being parachuted into Montreal on short notice.

“The day off was definitely good to unwind a little bit and make some phone calls. I received some text messages from friends, so it allowed me to get back to them and say thank you for supporting me. I’m from a small town, so the support was awesome,” admitted Hanley, whose parents were in the Bell Centre stands for his NHL debut on Sunday night against Calgary. “I think I was a little less nervous on Tuesday night, but that’s normal. I tried to control those nerves and turn them into excitement to help my play. I don’t know if it showed, but I just tried to play my game.”

Hanley’s road to the NHL ranks included several stops along the way. After wrapping up his collegiate career at the University of Massachusetts – Amherst in 2013-14, the Keswick, ON native joined the Arizona Coyotes organization, splitting his time between their ECHL affiliate in Gwinnett and their AHL club in Portland. Signed to a free-agent contract by the Canadiens last July 1st, the six-foot, 193-pound rearguard spent time in St. John’s over the last few months not knowing if he’d ever get a shot with the big club.

“I didn’t know what the chances were for me to get here, and I tried not look into that too much. You just play. If they call you, that’s what you hope for,” said Hanley, who benefitted from playing alongside a familiar face in Dietz with the Canadiens, his defense partner in St. John’s.  “I was fortunate with all the injuries here. I just try to play my best and help the team as much as I can.”

While Hanley travelled to Detroit with the rest of team on Wednesday afternoon and he’ll be in uniform on Thursday night, he knows he might soon be St. John’s bound with Subban nearing a return to active duty. Having played well so far, though, the young defenseman is adamant about focusing solely on the present and making the most of the opportunity he’s been presented with this time around. 

“It’s hard not to see that some guys will be coming back. At the same time, you can’t control anything, but you can control your play,” concluded Hanley, who picked up the first two points of his NHL career on Tuesday night. “If I’m playing, that’s awesome. If I’m not, I’ll just continue working hard and enjoy it one day at the time.”

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens vs. Red Wings</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875198</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (34-34-6) vs. Red Wings (36-26-11)

TV: RDS, SNE, NHLN-US 7:30 p.m.

The Habs take on the Red Wings in Detroit just five days before the Original Six teams are scheduled to square off once again at the Bell Centre.

In the Canadiens most recent game at the Bell Centre on Tuesday night, the Habs gave the Ducks all they could handle preventing Anaheim from clinching a playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Habs 4-3 victory featured a night of firsts as Mike Brown (1G-1A) and Lucas Lessio (1G) both lit the lamp for the first time as Canadiens. In addition, blue-liners Darren Dietz (1A) and Joel Hanley (2A) chipped in assists to collect their first NHL points in the victory.

On Tuesday night in Tampa Bay, the Red Wings suffered a 6-2 loss at the hands of the Lightning, with Justin Abdelkader and Darren Helm finding the back of the net for Detroit. Tampa is currently in the midst of battling the Philadelphia Flyers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Both Red Wings netminders saw action in the loss as Petr Mrázek replaced starter Jimmy Howard who was pulled after allowing three goals on 16 shots. As a result, Mrázek will be back in goal to face the Habs. 

Between the pipes, Mike Condon turned aside 32 of the 35 shots he faced sparking the Habs comeback victory. For Thursday night's affair in Detroit, the Habs will turn to netminder Ben Scrivens who is set to face the Red Wings for the second time in his career. 

In the injury department, P.K. Subban has been ruled out Thursday night’s clash while David Desharnais will make his return to the lineup and will slot in between Michael McCarron and Stefan Matteau. In addition, head coach Michel Therrien announced following the morning skate that forwards Sven Andrighetto and Jacob De La Rose will both be healthy scratches in Detroit.

The Habs and Red Wings split the first two games of the season series, with each club picking up a victory on home ice.</description>

         <title>Light at the end of the tunnel</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=875195</link>
         <description>BROSSARD - The long waiting line at the Habs infirmary seems to grow with each coming game; fortunately there is light at the end of the tunnel. 

On March 10, 2016, in the third period of a Thursday night contest between the Habs and Sabres, Canadiens All-Star defenseman P.K. Subban collided awkwardly with fellow blue-liner Alexei Emelin. The sold out crowd at the Bell Centre held its collective breath as Subban thrashed in pain before lying almost motionless in the aftermath of the dangerous impact. 

“It was scary. I’ve always been taught not to stay down on the ice, but whenever you start feeling weird sensations in your extremities, it can be scary. Once Graham [Rynbend] came out I knew it was best to just stay down and play it safe. We’ve had similar experiences at the Bell Centre before, but our medical staff always handles it professionally. They came to my aid and I know my parents were very appreciative,” expressed Subban, who had high praises for team’s medical staff who took every precaution when carefully setting up a stretcher to help transport the 26-year-old to the Montreal General Hospital. “Since it was my neck, the first thing I wanted to do was make sure I could move my hands and feet, that way if my parents or family was watching they would know I was ok. It was a scary situation but the important thing is that there is no structural damage.”

Thankfully, Subban - who presently ranks 2nd on the Habs in scoring with 51 points, despite being sidelined for the last six games due to the non-serious neck injury sustained that frightful night – has been progressing well and is nearing his return to the lineup. 

Just one day after suiting up in non-contact jerseys at Tuesday’s practice, the former Norris Trophy winner was back to being a full participant in Wednesday’s practice at the Bell Sports Complex, swapping his light-blue no-contact sweater for a standard Canadiens practice jersey. 

“Right now my focus is on getting back in the lineup. However, in my situation I just have to listen to the doctors. Right now I’m just taking it day by day. I’m still experiencing some symptoms related to the injury, and I’m not going to comeback unless I’m at 100%,” continued the former 2007 second round draft pick, who is not ready to suit up for Thursday night’s contest in Detroit, but will travel and practice with his teammates on the road. “We have the best training staff in the world. I trust those guys completely. So when they feel that I am ready to get back in and play, we will go from there. They also take into consideration how I am feeling, but I trust our doctors.”

While keeping the Habs workhorse on the sidelines was only logical, Subban’s remarkable iron-man streak was snapped at a 274 consecutive games after the rearguard was forced to miss the Habs game against the Senators just two days after he was cleared to leave the hospital. 

“It meant a lot to me to be able to play six years in this league without missing any games due to injury. If I had to choose a way to miss a game, that’s exactly how I would want to go out; an accidental collision rather than getting run over by an opponent,” acknowledged Subban, who was forced to sit out his very first game since January 30, 2013, which was also against the Ottawa Senators. “This is the first time that I’ve ever been out of the lineup due to injury, so I keep getting more and more anxious to return. Hopefully once I get back in the lineup, I can start on a new iron-man streak.” 

While Subban's status is up in the air for Thursday night's affair, another member of the Canadiens walking wounded is closing in on making his return to the lineup against the Red Wings. Centre David Desharnais, who has been shelved since February 15 thanks to a broken bone in his foot, was also a full participant at Wednesday morning’s practice in Brossard. 

“I knew right away that it was broken. But I feel better now. With a fracture, you never know how much time it will take to heal. The first time I stepped on the ice, everything seemed fine. However, after a while I started to experience a bit of pain and discomfort and had to take another week to recover. But here I am ready to start again. I might potentially be able to make my return to the lineup in Detroit,” clarified Desharnais, who presently sits just four games shy of reaching the 400-game plateau. 
“I’m excited to get back into the lineup and help my teammates. There are still eight games left to play, that's what I’m focused on right now. It definitely felt great to be back out with the guys for practice today. It hasn’t been an easy year for anyone, but it is encouraging to see the young guys stepping up. That’s just how hockey works. When I first arrived I needed to compete against the veterans to earn a spot. I’ve been in their shoes before.”

You would think a trip to the hospital would be enough to make even the toughest hockey players want some time off to relax, but as Desharnais says it best; “I'm a hockey player, and hockey players just want to play.”

         <description>MONTREAL – On a night when the Ducks could have punched their ticket to the postseason, the Habs were the ones who came out flying. 

It was a night of firsts for a handful of players in the Canadiens’ lineup on Tuesday night, as three different players registered their first points and two potted their first goals since arriving in Montreal. Darren Dietz chipped in with his first NHL helper in his fifth career NHL game, Lucas Lessio picked up his first goal as a Hab, Joel Hanley notched the first two points of his NHL career with a pair of assists, and Mike Brown scored a goal and added an assist to lift the home team to a 4-3 over Anaheim at the Bell Centre. 

“This was a character game. We showed up to play and we got the two points,” said Brown, referencing the team’s point haul instead of his personal stats line. “We’ve had our fair amount of chances, but we know we have to contribute. We can’t spend too much time in our D zone, and at the other end we have to pop some pucks in. We’ve been waiting a little bit of time, but we finally got a couple tonight and helped the boys win, so it was huge for us.”

Brown – who came one fight shy of completing the Gordie Howe Hat Trick – entered the night as the Canadiens’ penalty minute leader against the Ducks, with 42 PIMs in 16 games played. He ended the evening by tossing pucks into the crowd after earning first star honors, scoring his first as a Hab in the second period before assisting on Lucas Lessio’s eventual game winner in the third. 

“He looked like Joey Thornton on that one, for sure,” described Lessio with a chuckle on his linemate’s perfect pass from behind the net. “I called for it and he put it right on my stick. I was grateful it went in – I definitely said thank you to him for that one. I thought he played a solid game tonight. He was one of our best players, if not our best player, and to see a guy like that get rewarded – a guy who does his job every night and a great team guy – is special.” 

Brown wasn’t the only one who finally had a chance to see his hard work pay off on Tuesday night. A spark plug in each of the 11 games he’s played for the Habs this year, Lessio became the 26th player to score a goal for the Canadiens in 2015-16 when he beat John Gibson in the third period. 

“I’ve gotten pretty close at times and it starts to get frustrating when you’re not getting the results,” admitted the 23-year-old winger, who arrived in Montreal via a trade with Arizona on December 15. “We’ve just been trying to play our game every night: work hard and work for the team. We’ve had chances, but chances don’t count unless they cross the line, so to see it go in tonight was definitely a big relief.” 

No stranger to seeing pucks cross the goal line this season, Alex Galchenyuk continued his torrid scoring pace by blasting home his 27th of the campaign off a great feed from Max Pacioretty. But even he enjoyed a first of sorts on Tuesday night, getting called on to take his first shorthanded, defensive zone faceoff of the season – which he won – to continue cementing his status as a full-time, first-line NHL center. 

“You’ve got guys battling for positions next year, so every game is an audition,” explained Lessio, who played 7:34 against Anaheim. “Every shift counts for a lot of guys and tonight really showed that. A lot of younger guys stepped up and the veterans were great tonight. If we keep playing like that, I think we’re going to win a lot more than we’re going to lose.”

         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (33-34-6) vs. Ducks (40-22-9)

TV: RDS, SNE 7:30 p.m.

The Habs welcome the Anaheim Ducks to the Bell Centre on Tuesday night for the first time since December 18, 2014.

Though the Canadiens faced a four goal deficit in the third period of Sunday night’s contest against the Calgary Flames, the Bell Centre crowd was sent into a frenzy when big Michael McCarron deflected home his first career NHL goal.  

In the Ducks’ camp, Jakob Silfverberg’s 13th goal of the season gave Anaheim a 3-2 overtime victory over the Jets with just under a minute remaining in the extra frame. The Ducks starter for Tuesday night has yet to be confirmed, but Anaheim could turn to netminder Frederik Andersen who is fresh off a 38-save shutout performance against the Boston Bruins on March 18.

Between the pipes, rookie netminder Mike Condon suited up for his 48th game of the season on Sunday night, tying his personal career high for games played in a single season. The 25-year-old will be back between the pipes on Tuesday night in his second career game against Anaheim, as the goaltender kicked aside 33 of the 35 shots he faced in the Habs 3-2 loss to the Ducks on March 2, 2016. 

In the injury department, Brendan Gallagher, Daniel Carr and Brian Flynn all skated in full equipment with athletic therapist Vincent Roof-Racine. In addition, P.K Subban and David Desharnais hit the ice and joined their teammates for practice while sporting light-blue non-contact jerseys. While emergency call-up Joel Hanley remains with the team as P.K. Subban is not expected to suit up for Tuesday night’s match. 

The last contest between the two teams required a shootout to settle the score with Jakob Silfverberg scoring the game winning goal.</description>

         <title>IceCaps report – March 21</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=874830</link>
         <description>The Montreal Canadiens have a new farm team this season, the St. John's IceCaps. To help Canadiens fans track the team's performance in the AHL, we have invited Charles Dart, website contributor of the IceCaps' official website to prepare a bi-weekly summary of the action in Newfoundland.

ST. JOHN’S – Spring has arrived and the IceCaps are down to their final 10 games of their inaugural season as the Canadiens’ AHL affiliate. St. John’s (28-27-8-3 | 0.508%) sits sixth in the North Division and chase the Atlantic Division’s Portland Pirates (32-24-5-2 | 0.563%), who currently occupy the second wild card spot and have 13 games remaining on their schedule. The AHL season wraps up on Sunday, April 17th.

The Calder Cup Playoff Primer is updated daily to show the standings and chances of all AHL teams making this year’s playoffs. Only one team has been officially eliminated (Manitoba Moose) and one team has clinched (Toronto Marlies).

The IceCaps have a tough road ahead to make the playoffs. Eight of their 10 remaining contests are against teams ahead of them in the standings, and while St. John’s is just four points behind Portland, the IceCaps have three more games played. 

The remaining two games are against the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, who sit six points behind the IceCaps in the Eastern Conference standings. 

--

With the college hockey free agency season underway, the organization signed defenseman Christopher Joyaux and forward Cory Ward to Amateur Tryout Contracts (ATO).

Joyaux, 23, is a product of the Miami University of Ohio Redhawks while Ward, 22, is coming off his fourth season with the Bemidji State University Beavers. 

Both players made their AHL debuts this weekend, bringing the total number of players to make their AHL debuts this season with the IceCaps to 14.

St. John’s now has 15 rookie skaters on a roster of 25 (excluding Michaël Bournival and Connor Crisp, who are in Montreal for extended medical treatment). The Manitoba Moose have the second-most rookies with 12 skaters.

--

Bud Holloway continues to lead all IceCaps players with 36 assists - a single-season record for the Saskatchewan native. Holloway is seven points behind his personal best of 61 points in a season. 

Sophomore Charles Hudon tallied his team-leading 21st and 22nd goals in Sunday’s 6-2 loss to the Syracuse Crunch. His personal best was set last season with 19.

Team captain Gabriel Dumont is just two points away from tying his single-season points record of 45, also set last season with the Bulldogs.

Holloway (54), Hudon (45), and Dumont (43) occupy the top three spots in scoring on the IceCaps.

Goaltender Eddie Pasquale has had the hot hand in net as of late, recording a 4-2-0 record in his last seven games along with a .939 SV% and a 1.75 GAA. Zach Fucale is 1-5-1 in his past six starts.

The IceCaps are currently in the midst of a seven-game road trip and are 1-2-0 thus far. They play the North Division’s fourth-seeded Rochester Americans as well as the Toronto Marlies twice each before returning home to close out their season with six home games.</description>

         <description>MONTREAL - Despite a tough loss to the Calgary Flames, rookie Michael McCarron is heading home with a smile on his face and a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. 

With the Canadiens trailing by four goals in the third period on Sunday night, Nathan Beaulieu fired a shot from the blue-line towards the large shadow cast by the net-front presence of the Habs big No. 34. Using the soft hands that helped the former London Knight become a 2013 first-round draft pick, McCarron deftly deflected the point shot through Flames netminder Niklas Backstrom to score his first career NHL goal.

“It was really exciting. I’ve dreamt of that moment since I was kid. It was also a special feeling just to see how excited the guys on the bench were,” revealed the Grosse Pointe, Michigan native, who sent the Bell Centre faithful into a frenzy with his late third period marker. “Moving forward I’ll just try to stick to the same game plan; crash the net and grab those greasy pucks. The front of the net is where I am going to score most of my goals, I’m just happy that one finally went in for me. The fans gave me a very memorable salute, so I have to thank them for that. They were awesome.”

The excitement was palpable on McCarron’s face as the Bell Centre roared, as evidenced by the rookie’s double celebratory fist-pump and a smile big enough to match his 6’6” frame. 

“I don’t think I was able to hold in my excitement. I had a huge smile on my face and chills running down my whole body,” expressed the former Memorial Cup winner back in 2015 with the Oshawa Generals. “I think one of the guys went and grabbed the puck for me. It’s going right to my mom. I’m sure both of my parents have already texted me. I’ll be calling them as soon as I get home after the game tonight.” 

While the 21-year-old’s first career goal puck will certainly have a special place built in the McCarron residence, the limited edition collectible was almost lost forever. As the Bell Centre erupted in celebration, the puck meanwhile was lost somewhere within a maze of tangled mesh. 

Were it not for a hard working referee, the rookie's first NHL goal puck might still be stuck in the back of one of the Bell Centre nets. Luckily teammate Stefan Matteau was patiently waiting to deliver the souvenir from the back of the net to the trusted hands of the Canadiens equipment staff. 

Behind the bench, Canadiens coach Michel Therrien has also taken note of McCarron’s progress since the rookie first suited up for his National Hockey League debut on December 19, 2015 on the road against the Dallas Stars. 

“Lately we’ve seen him putting a lot of pucks on net and he’s been a tough and physical presence in front of the crease. Tonight, he was finally rewarded for his efforts,” noted Therrien, who was quick to shift McCarron to his natural center ice position after just a few games on the wing. “We’ve seen some great things from such a young player; he is great at protecting the puck and uses his size to be an imposing net-front presence. That’s exactly how he scored his first career goal.”

Initially expected to spend the year plying his trade with the St. John’s IceCaps of the AHL, McCarron was given the opportunity to showcase his talents with the Canadiens as the team endured a never-ending saga of injuries. With a fearless determination to plant himself in front of the opposing team’s net, the power forward has done his best Brendan Gallagher impression with the Habs energizer bunny presently sidelined with a lower-body injury.

“The front of the net is where I like to play. Not a lot of people go there and you need somebody on your team that does that. You see Brendan Gallagher. He does that all the time and he makes a living of it. If he can, why can’t I?” concluded McCarron.

If Sunday night proved one thing, it’s that Big Mike McCarron has the skill set, the determination, and of course the pearly whites, to be the next Gallagher.

         <title>The Numbers Game: March 20, 2016</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=874689</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - Here's a numerical look at Sunday night's game against the Flames in Montreal.

14 – The number of months that elapsed after signing his first professional contract before defenseman Joel Hanley made his NHL debut on Sunday night at the Bell Centre.

13 – The number of different defensemen that have suited up for at least one game with the Canadiens this season, as newcomer Joel Hanley added his name to a list including PK Subban, Andrei Markov, Jeff Petry, Alexei Emelin, Nathan Beaulieu, Tom Gilbert, Greg Pateryn Jarred Tinordi, Mark Barberio, Victor Bartley, Morgan Ellis and Darren Dietz.

16 – The number of times the Canadiens played a series of back-to-back games this season, as Sunday night’s contest marks the final time the Habs were scheduled to play on consecutive days this campaign, culminating in a 12-17-3. 

423 – As in 423 games of additional NHL experience that Andrei Markov has over the rest of the Habs defense core combined, as the veteran blue-liner’s 919 career games played heading into Sunday night’s contest is a whopping 423 more than the 496 combined games played by Darren Dietz, Alexei Emelin, Nathan Beaulieu, Greg Pateryn, and Joel Hanley. 

432 – The number of days that elapsed since Flames netminder Nicklas Backstrom last started an NHL game, as the 38-year-old returned to the blue paint for the first time since January 13, 2015, a span of 432 days. 

7 – The number of hits dished out by Greg Pateryn on Sunday night as the Habs physical defenseman increased his season total to 81 hits in just 28 games played thus far this season, which is good for 7th on the team in that regard. 

14 – The number of games it took Michael McCarron to score his first career NHL goal, as the former first-round pick lit the lamp for the first time in his young career beating Niklas Backstrom with a deflection in the slot to bring the Bell Centre to its feet.

         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (33-33-6) vs. Flames (30-35-6)

TV: RDS, SN 7:00 p.m.

The Canadiens return to Montreal where a match-up against the Calgary Flames awaits them just 24-hours after taking on the Senators in Ottawa.

In the Habs most recent game on Saturday night at the Canadian Tire Centre, the Senators picked up two points in the standings with a 5-0 shutout victory. Ben Scrivens did his best to keep the Canadiens in the game kicking aside 39 saves in the loss. 

Meanwhile, the Flames arrive in Montreal on the heels of a 4-3 shootout loss to the Colorado Avalanche. In a thrilling comeback victory Patrick Roy’s troops erased a two goal deficit to force a shootout, after Toronto, Ontario native Freddie Hamilton scored his first goal of the season to put Calgary up 3-1 in the second period.

As Scrivens got the nod against the Senators in Kanata, rookie netminder Mike Condon will return to defending the Canadiens crease on Sunday night at the Bell Centre. Opposite Condon, recently acquired Nicklas Backstrom will get the nod between the pipes for the Flames. The veteran netminder will be making his first NHL appearance since January 13, 2015 when he was a member of the Minnesota Wild. 

In the injury department, blue-liners Mark Barberio (concussion-like symptoms) P.K. Subban (upper-body) are not expected to suit up against the Flames. In addition, the Canadiens announced that defenseman Joel Hanley has been called up from St. John’s to join the Habs as part of an emergency recall after Victor Bartley suffered a lower-body injury on Saturday night in Ottawa. Bartley’s status is considered day-to-day.

Lastly, prior to puck drop the Canadiens announced that forward Sven Andrighetto will not be available for tonight's contest due to an upper-body injury. Jacob de la Rose draws back into the lineup to fill the void left by Andrighetto. 

When the two teams met for the first time this season back on October 30, 2015 the Canadiens came away victorious to the tune of 6-2.</description>

         <title>One rough night</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=874577</link>
         <description>KANATA – There are some nights over the course of any regular season that you’d like to forget. That’s just the way things go.

On Saturday night, the Canadiens surrendered three short-handed goals en route to dropping a 5-0 decision to the Ottawa Senators at the Canadian Tire Centre. It marked the first time the Canadiens had been blanked on road ice all season long, and just the second time they failed to find the back of the net in a contest all year. 

That wasn’t any consolation to Michel Therrien’s troops in the aftermath of their third loss in their last four games, though, and with good reason.

“It’s unacceptable. Everyone offered up a bad effort. We weren’t playing together. We weren’t following the system. We weren’t winning our battles. It was an unacceptable loss tonight,” said Phillip Danault, who watched as the Senators scored one short-handed tally in each of the three periods on Saturday night. “It’s unacceptable to let down the way we did in the third period. That’s the biggest thing. You have to find a way to stay in the game. [Mike] Brown stepped up for us and fought with [Chris] Neil. It was a big team move. After that, you have to find a way to move forward. We didn’t do that tonight.”

Dave Cameron’s squad outshot the Canadiens by a 44-30 margin, capitalizing on a few bad bounces while down a man to beat their Atlantic Division rivals in their own barn. Jean-Gabriel Pageau, Curtis Lazar and Alex Chiasson accounted for the short-handed markers on Ben Scrivens, while Marc Methot and Mika Zibanejad chipped in with goals of their own.

“It was a tough night. It’s the NHL. You’ve got to show up and play hard and it didn’t happen,” said captain Max Pacioretty. “Just watch the goals. We just gave them three goals. I think we had some chances and some good zone time during the game, but with three errors like that –two breakaways and a 2-on-1 [while short-handed] – that obviously can’t happen. They made us pay for it.”

Scrivens, meanwhile, shared in his teammates’ frustration and disappointment.

“I can’t comment on how everyone else feels or anything. I thought I was playing well. Through two periods, it’s a close game. I thought I made some good saves. I was trying to give the team a chance. Obviously, in the third period I’ve got to try to do a better job at that. But, I’ll go over the video here with Stephane [Waite] and see what we can correct,” said Scrivens, who, despite making 39 saves, suffered his seventh loss of the season after winning his two previous starts. “I thought I battled hard the whole night. My goal is to just give the team a chance. It kind of got away at the end.”

The Canadiens’ bench boss is in full agreement there.

“I’ve never seen that, three goals scored against a team while they’re on the power play,” said Therrien, whose contingent will be back in action on Sunday night against the Calgary Flames at the Bell Centre. “It’s a lack of execution and concentration.”

         <description>KANATA - Here's a numerical look at Saturday night's game against the Senators in Ottawa.

16 – Saturday night’s contest against the Senators at the Canadian Tire Centre marked the start of the Canadiens’ 16th and final back-to-back set of games during the regular season. Following the tilt, Michel Therrien’s troops will return to Montreal where they’ll battle the Calgary Flames on Sunday night at the Bell Centre.

918 – Number of games defenseman Andrei Markov has suited up for with the Canadiens over the course of his NHL career, including Saturday night’s game in Ottawa. By donning the CH against the Senators, the Russian rearguard took sole possession of ninth place on the Canadiens’ all-time games played list, surpassing Serge Savard.

30 – Number of shots the Canadiens and Senators combined to generate during a wide-open first period on Saturday night. Dave Cameron’s squad fired 17 shots in Ben Scrivens’ direction and scored once, while the Canadiens tested Senators netminder Andrew Hammond 13 times, but failed to light the lamp.

2 – Number of times Mike Brown and Senators tough guy Chris Neil have gone toe-to-toe over the course of their respective NHL careers, with their latest bout coming late in the first period on Saturday night. Their last scrap came back on October 9, 2010 when Brown was a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

8 – Number of games it took Mike Brown to find himself atop the Canadiens’ fight card list – alongside Nathan Beaulieu – with three fights so far this season for the bleu-blanc-rouge. You’ll recall that Brown joined the Canadiens at the trade deadline back on February 29 after being claimed off waivers from the San Jose Sharks.

15 – Number of Canadiens players who registered at least one shot on goal on Saturday night. Stefan Matteau, Torrey Mitchell and Greg Pateryn were the only players who didn’t manage to challenge Hammond at the other end of the ice.

2 – Number of Canadiens players who didn't manage to dish out a hit on Saturday night in Ottawa, as Michel Therrien's troops tried to play a physical game against their Atlantic Division rivals. Only Lars Eller and Victor Bartley didn't put up a number in the hit department, while Mike Brown led the way with five hits of his own.

         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (32-32-6) vs. Senators (33-31-8)

TV: RDS, SN 7:00 p.m.

Two Atlantic Division rivals will go head-to-head for the final time this regular season, as the Habs and Sens square off on Saturday night at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa. 

The Habs most recent game on Wednesday night in Buffalo proved to be just as exciting as it was physical. At the end of the night the Habs skated away with a 3-2 victory thanks to an unassisted overtime goal by Paul Byron. With a combined five goals, four periods, 65 shots on net and of course 100 minutes in penalties, Wednesday night’s clash had it all. 

Meanwhile the Senators sit just two points ahead of the Canadiens in the Eastern Conference standings after suffering a 3-1 defeat at the hands of the Buffalo Sabres on Friday night. As Craig Anderson got the nod against Buffalo, Andrew Hammond could make his first appearance between the pipes since March 8 against Carolina.

Coach Michel Therrien will turn once again to Ben Scrivens after the netminder put forth a 41-save effort in the Wednesday’s overtime thriller. In five career starts against the Senators, Scrivens sports a 2-2-1 record complete with a .924 save percentage and one shutout to his credit. Meanwhile, the coach also announced that Mike Condon will get the nod on Sunday night against the Calgary Flames. 

In the injury department, blue-liner Mark Barberio (concussion-like symptoms) is out indefinitely after being forced to leave Wednesday night’s contest against the Sabres after suffering a lower-body injury. The Canadiens subsequently brought Darren Dietz back up to the NHL from the St. John’s IceCaps, as part of an emergency recall. In addition, coach Therrien confirmed that P.K. Subban will not suit up for either of the Canadiens two games this weekend. 

The Canadiens presently hold the upper hand in the season series, after picking up five points in the three contests between the two teams this season.</description>

         <description>BROSSARD – Seven-year-old Nathan Chouinard suited up for a skate to remember on Friday morning.

The Sherbrooke native, who suffers from a rare congenital disorder known as ectrodactyly which causes malformations in both the hands and feet, donned his goalie equipment for a once-in-a-lifetime on-ice session with both Carey Price and Canadiens goaltending coach Stephane Waite at the Bell Sports Complex. Defenseman P.K. Subban even joined in on the fun, taking shots on the Novice B netminder during the latter stages of his workout while Nathan’s parents and siblings looked on from the stands with pride and amazement.

“It all goes back to when Radio-Canada Estrie came by to film a practice with Nathan and his team over the holidays. The director of Hockey Sherbrooke, Jean-Guy Rancourt, saw the story and right away came up with the idea of organizing a special event for Nathan. Jean-Guy thought he displayed such great perseverance and that he was also a great example of courage and determination. He said he’d try to organize something with an NHL player,” said Nathan’s mother, Janie Simard.

Enter Waite, a fellow Sherbrooke native, who saw Nathan’s story and wasted little time putting a plan into action with the help of the reigning Hart Trophy, Vezina Trophy, William M. Jennings Trophy and Ted Lindsay Award winner.

“I saw it and I had Carey come by my office. He thought we were going to have a normal video session, but I wanted to show him the story on Nathan. It made quite the impression on the both of us,” shared Waite, who worked on basic goaltending techniques with Nathan, and also had the youngster help Price with his individual workout, too. “I asked him if he was interested in doing something with Nathan at practice, and he agreed to do it right away. Carey said that he’d be happy to have him at practice when he got back on the ice.”

Nathan’s mother was ecstatic to see her son live out his hockey dream on Friday.

“Nathan was born with a few malformations. He doesn’t have all of his fingers or his toes. But, he’s very skilled and determined that nothing would stand in the way of him playing hockey. He’s been playing since the age of four and skating since the age of three. This was a very emotional experience for him and for us, too. This is a magical and unique experience,” said Simard, who also recalled the moment Nathan learned he’d be practicing with Price and Waite last week.

“When Nathan found out, he thought he’d be practicing with all of the guys. That made him very nervous. He said: ‘Mom, I won’t be able to stop all of the pucks. I’m going to give up a lot of goals,’” added Simard. “When I told him that he’d be alone with Carey, he was relieved.”

So, what did Nathan think about skating with his hockey idols?

“I was a little shy, to be honest. But, I was also very happy. I learned some important lessons,” he said. “It was exciting. I feel very lucky. I want to play like Carey one day.”

         <description>MONTREAL - Living up to the high standards set by the legendary captains who preceded him will take time, but Max Pacioretty welcomes the challenge. 

A year after donning the ‘A’ as part of a leadership quartet alongside P.K. Subban, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Markov, the Montreal Canadiens players united to elect Max Pacioretty as their new captain. 

However, with the Habs presently on the outside of the playoff picture as the 2015-16 season draws to a close, it is safe to say that the former 22nd overall pick’s premiere season as captain did not go according to plan.

“There is definitely a big learning curve to being a captain. Hopefully at the end of the day I can learn a lot from this season. I am confident that facing a lot of adversity will make me a better captain at the end of the day,” shared Pacioretty, who has been at the helm of one of the strangest seasons in recent memory. “I think we had over 30 guys in the team picture. That’s rare to see in the NHL but seems normal for us based on how this season has gone.”

For a first-year captain, an ever-changing cast of teammates in the room certainly doesn’t make the job any easier. The impact injuries have had on the Habs this season can be evidenced by the night of March 11, 2016, when the Habs welcomed the Minnesota Wild to the Bell Centre. Of the 20 players who suited up for the Canadiens that night, only seven – including four forwards, two defensemen and one netminder – actually started the season in Montreal. 

Fortunately, guiding a first-year captain through the perils of the job is not new territory for Habs bench boss Michel Therrien, who helped shape Pittsburgh Penguins’ Sidney Crosby into one of the most dynamic and  respected captains in the NHL.

“Pacioretty is a young captain; this season is just part of the learning process for him. He’s going to learn a lot from this year about being a captain and about being a leader,” commented Therrien, who along with general manager Marc Bergevin decided to pay a personal house call to the Pacioretty residence to break the exciting news. “You have to remember that there’s a learning curve to being a captain. Pacioretty focuses on doing the right things and emphasizes the importance of communication. It takes time to develop. You can’t just give the ‘C’ to a guy. It takes time to learn and adapt. Gaining experience and facing adversity will help him become a better captain and he’s learning that on the job.”

At just 27-year-old, Pacioretty has already had to overcome a great deal personal adversity in his young career. His 2012 Bill Masterton trophy - for best exemplifying the qualities of perseverance, team spirit and dedication to the sport of hockey – is a reminder of how courageously he overcame a concussion and a non-displaced fractured fourth cervical vertebra in his neck. 

With regards to team adversity however, the young captain has only experienced one season in his seven year NHL career where the Canadiens did not manage to secure a playoff spot. 
“Handling adversity has helped make me the player I am today. Not everybody in this room has a lot of experience dealing with hardships. So this is new for a lot of people,” shared Pacioretty, who brought the Bell Centre to its feet when he was handed the iconic torch by former captain – and the last Habs leader to hoist the Stanley Cup – Guy Carbonneau. “But we made a pact in this room that we are going to stand up for each other no matter what.,” 

How does a captain inspire his team when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds?

“My message to the guys is just to play hard. The door is open for a lot of guys to make a good impression, it’s up to them to play well and take advantage of it,” clarified the former product of the AHL’s Hamilton Bulldogs, who plied his trade for two full seasons in the AHL before he was ready to make the transition up to the Canadiens. “At the beginning of this year it was starting to look like we would never need to make a call-up, and the next thing you know it looks like we need to make another call up every day due to injuries.”

In the face of all of the adversity the Habs have faced this year, Pacioretty continues to prove that he possesses the mental agility required to motivate his teammates. 

“My biggest motivation right now is to play for our fans. They’ve been supporting us throughout this tough stretch. Every night at the Bell Centre, we’ve worked hard every game and the fans have recognized that. It’s been really nice to see the support we’ve gotten,” revealed Pacioretty, whose ties to Montreal are stronger than you may think, as his roots trace back to his paternal grandmother Theresa Pacioretty who is a French-Canadian from Montreal. “The fans here in Montreal, they get hockey and they understand what is going on in this room.”

They say that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. The expectation and hope is that this year’s experience will make the team and its captain stronger and more resilient in the challenges that lie ahead.

         <title>Raw emotion</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=874123</link>
         <description>BUFFALO - When two teams square off three times in less than a month, they’re bound to develop a serious dislike for one another. It’s almost inevitable.
 
On Wednesday night, the Canadiens and Sabres displayed that mutual distaste by engaging in a rough-and-tumble affair at the First Niagara Center that included a seemingly endless parade to the penalty box during the middle frame.

Fifty-two minutes in penalties were handed out over the course of the second period alone, including multiple misconducts on both sides.
 
Fortunately, Michel Therrien’s troops found a way to use the emotional nature of the tilt to their advantage and come away with a 3-2 overtime victory that snapped a two-game losing streak.
 
“I’m proud of our team. We played with a lot of character today. Everybody battled. Sometimes, you’re involved in very physical games. It’s good for our team to play games like that,” said Paul Byron, who scored the game-winning goal at the 3:15 mark of overtime. “When you play a team five times a year or two to three times in the same month, there will naturally be some animosity. The Sabres are a big team and they play hard. I like physical games like these. They’re fun to play.”
 
That’s exactly the way defenseman Greg Pateryn felt in the aftermath of the Canadiens’ 71st game of the season, which came 24 hours after dropping a 4-1 decision to the Florida Panthers on home ice. The defeat didn’t sit well with Pateryn &amp; Co., who were eager to get after a Sabres squad that certainly doesn’t shy away from trying to intimidate the opposition.
 
“I think everyone knew after last game that we needed to come back strong and respond with a good team victory. I think that’s what we did. That’s really the group of guys that we have,” said Pateryn, who scored his first career NHL goal on Wednesday night, blasting a slap shot that found its way through Sabres netminder Robin Lehner early in the second period. “I really like playing those types of games. It kind of shows everyone’s attitude and character. It was a good win.”
 
Based on the way things played out when the two clubs last met on Mar. 10 in Montreal, it’s safe to say both groups knew exactly what was coming. Pateryn and Mike Brown both dropped the gloves last week, and goaltender Ben Scrivens nearly did the same in their latest meeting, almost going toe-to-toe with Lehner on the opposite end of the ice.
 
“We know each other going back a while. We were rookies in the AHL together and made our way up. We’ve got some history. We consider ourselves friends, but friends off the ice is not the same as teammates on the ice,” said Scrivens, who made 41 saves on Wednesday night to register his fifth win of the year. “I was prepared to go down. I don’t want to predict how well I would have done. He’s a big boy. I think he’s maybe a little wilder than I am.”
 
That being said, Scrivens appreciated the physical nature of the game in front of him, which earned the Canadiens another two points in their quest to remain in the Eastern Conference’s wild card chase.
 
“Every game is its own entity. You’re just trying to play as best you can and try to come out with a win. Sometimes, they’re rough. Sometimes, you play games where there are one or two penalties all game. You have to find ways to win different types of games,” explained Scrivens. “We’re fortunate to come out with a win tonight by winning it in overtime. If we play our next game with no penalties, we’ll have to find a way to win that one, too.”
 
With a game against the rival Ottawa Senators on the horizon on Saturday night, though, it could very well be another game just like this one. That suits the Canadiens just fine.
 
“I think sometimes all it really takes is one hit, something to start that. Then, guys start pushing back. It’s just about responding,” said Pateryn. “I think it’s just about standing up for your teammates. That shows our character in here.”

         <title>The Numbers Game: March 16, 2016</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=874122</link>
         <description>BUFFALO - Here's a numerical look at Wednesday night's game against the Sabres in Buffalo.

400 – Number of NHL games tough guy Mike Brown has played over the course of his NHL career, including Wednesday night’s contest against the Buffalo Sabres at the First Niagara Center. Brown, who made his NHL debut back in 2007-08 with the Vancouver Canucks, has also played for the Edmonton Oilers, Anaheim Ducks, Toronto Maple Leafs and San Jose Sharks, before the Canadiens claimed him off waivers at the trade deadline two weeks ago. 

9 – Spot defenseman Andrei Markov now occupies on the Canadiens’ all-time games played list – alongside Serge Savard – after suiting up for his 917th career game in a Habs uniform on Wednesday night. Guy Lafleur is next on that list, having played 961 games with Montreal over the course of his Hall-of-Fame career.

10 – Defenseman Nathan Beaulieu returned to active duty on Wednesday night after missing 10 games with a lower-body injury suffered on February 22 against the Nashville Predators. 

47 – Greg Pateryn lit the lamp for the first time in his NHL career on Wednesday night, beating Sabres netminder Robin Lehner with a slap shot during the middle frame to tie things up 1-1. It was the 47th game of Pateryn’s young career, which began back in 2012-13. Ironically enough, the tally came at the 47-second mark of the period.

22 – Number of seconds that elapsed between Pateryn scoring his first NHL goal and the Canadiens’ No. 6 being sent to the penalty box for tripping rookie sensation Jack Eichel, an infraction that cut his goal celebration rather short, unfortunately.

11 – Number of points Alex Galchenyuk has picked up in his last eight games since the beginning of March, tops among all players on the roster. Galchenyuk added to that tally on Wednesday night by picking up an assist on Pateryn’s goal.

52 – Number of penalty minutes that were distributed during the second period alone on Wednesday night, as both the Canadiens and Sabres displayed a serious dislike for one another, particularly in the latter stages of the frame. Nathan Beaulieu, Michael McCarron and Matt Moulson all received 10-minute misconducts along the way.

6 – Number of consecutive games in which Max Pacioretty's has registered his name on the scoresheet, keeping that streak alive on Wednesday night by picking up an assist on Andrei Markov's tally with just three seconds remaining in the second period that gave the Canadiens a 2-1 lead. Pacioretty has eight points during that span.

7 – Number of times over the course of his NHL career that Andrei Markov has reached the 40-point mark in a single season, accomplishing that feat once again on Wednesday night by scoring his fifth goal of the year.

         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (32-32-6) vs. Buffalo (28-33-9)

TV: RDS, SN 7:00 p.m.

The Habs and Sabres square off for the second time in the last six days, this time at First Niagara Center in Buffalo.  

In the first leg of back-to-back games, the Canadiens took on the Florida Panthers at the Bell Centre on Tuesday night. Sniper Alex Galchenyuk picked up his eighth point in his last five games, scoring the lone goal for the Habs in the loss.

In the Sabres camp, rookie sensation Jack Eichel sits just one point behind Ryan O’Reilly for the team lead in points after a two goal performance – including the overtime winner - in Saturday night’s 3-2 victory over Carolina. Between the pipes Chad Johnson kicked aside 28 of the 30 shots he faced to extend his win streak to an impressive four games. 

As Mike Condon got the nod against the Panthers, the Habs will turn to Ben Scrivens to defend the blue paint in Buffalo. The Spruce Grove, Alberta native sports a 3-2-2 record in seven career starts against the Sabres. 

In the injury department, the Canadiens confirmed that both Lars Eller and Nathan Beaulieu will make their returns to the lineup against Buffalo. As a result, Eller takes Stefan Matteau's spot in the formations, while Beaulieu's return allows the Habs to return emergency-recall Darren Dietz back to the St. John's IceCaps.  

Back on March 10, 2016, the Canadiens 3-2 victory over the Sabres evened the season-series up at 2-2. Puck drop for the fifth and final game between the two Atlantic Division combatants is set for 7:00 p.m.</description>

         <title>Next man up</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=873917</link>
         <description>MONTREAL – The number of man games lost to injury continues to grow by the day in Montreal, and the team’s young stars are looking to make the most of the opportunity.  

One day after the Canadiens took what may have been the largest team photo in franchise history, with 31 players suiting up on picture day, the Habs iced a youth-laden lineup against the Panthers punctuated by six rookies and nine players counting 50 or fewer games of NHL experience.  With the team’s injured reserve crew currently overcrowding the Canadiens’ clinic, some of the organization’s young guns have been given an opportunity to show what they can do on the big stage. 

Continuing his torrid scoring pace with another goal on Tuesday night, 22-year-old center Alex Galchenyuk now needs just four more to crack the 30-goal plateau for the first time in his career. Fellow 22-year-old forward, Sven Andrighetto, has slipped in seamlessly alongside Galchenyuk and Max Pacioretty on the team’s top line, while Mark Barberio looks increasingly comfortable next to Andrei Markov on the Canadiens’ first power play unit. Rookie bruiser Michael McCarron has been throwing his weight around all over the ice, while Darren Dietz led the Habs with seven hits against the Panthers. 

“It is an audition,” admitted Lucas Lessio, who is one of 40 players to have played at least one game for the Canadiens in 2015-16. “When you’re playing your best, you’re giving your team an opportunity to win at the same time. I just want to pitch in any way I can. I’m getting some chances and it would be nice to see that turn into production soon, but I just have to keep moving my feet. Tomorrow’s another one, so I have to just put the same effort in there.”

Having landed in St. John’s via a trade with the Coyotes in December, Lessio was called up to the big club at the end of January and has been using his time in the spotlight as a chance to potentially earn a starring role in the long-term. After starting his Canadiens career in the single digits in ice time, Lessio played a season-high 13:10 against Florida on Tuesday night.

“I think as a player, you work your whole life, you work during the summer, you work during the year for these opportunities. You can’t be scared of them; you have to take the bull by the horns,” said the 23-year-old winger, who had four hits and three shots in the 4-1 loss to the Panthers. “I don’t think any young guy wants to go to the NHL to be a full-time fourth-liner. That’s something that over time you might settle into, but I’m still pretty young in the league, I only have 35 or 36 games, so every night I’m just trying to work my way up the lineup and hopefully stay in the lineup.”

Of the 20 players who were in uniform to take on the Leafs on opening night on October 7, only seven were on the ice on Tuesday to face the Panthers. That number includes rookie netminder Mike Condon, who was backing up Carey Price when the season kicked off in Toronto. In addition to Price, who has been out of commission since November 26, the team is also currently without the services of regulars like P.K. Subban, Brendan Gallagher, Jeff Petry, Tom Gilbert, Lars Eller, Daniel Carr, Brian Flynn, David Desharnais, and Nathan Beaulieu. 

Adopting a “next man up” attitude since the season began, the Habs continue to soldier on despite the revolving door to the team’s clinic.

“We can’t use injuries as an excuse. It’s the reality of this league,” stressed Barberio, who, notched his 10th point of the season with an assist on Galchenyuk’s second-period goal. “Every team has injuries. We’re obviously in a rough spell but it can’t be an excuse for us. Whatever 20 guys we put out on our lineup, we need to get the job done.”

The audition continues on Wednesday in Buffalo when the Canadiens face the Sabres for the second time in two weeks.

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=873916</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - Here's a numerical look at Tuesday night's game against the Florida Panthers at the Bell Centre. 

8 – Number of Habs players in the lineup on Tuesday who were not yet born when Jaromir Jagr made his NHL debut against the Washington Capitals, on October 5, 1990.    

27 – Number of teams Mike Condon has now played against in his rookie NHL season after crossing the Panthers off the list on Tuesday night. The only three teams the 25-year-old netminder has yet to face are the Oilers, Red Wings, and Canadiens.  

67 – Number of opponents Mike Brown now counts on his NHL fight card after going toe-to-toe with Panthers heavyweight Shawn Thornton for the first time in his career on Tuesday night. 
    
2 – Number of times Brown has dropped the gloves since joining the Canadiens at the 2016 NHL Trade Deadline, having collected two fighting majors in six games as a Hab. 

26 – Number of goals scored by Alex Galchenyuk this season, vaulting him into the Top 20 in the NHL in that category after potting his seventh in the past five games in the second period against the Panthers.  

11 – Number of hits dished out by Darren Dietz over the course of his first two NHL games, racking up seven on Tuesday to lead the Habs in that category against Florida. 

29 – Number of points needed by Mark Barberio in 2015-16 to tie his career-high for points with 10, a personal benchmark he last hit as a member of the Lightning in 49 games in 2013-14, before chipping in with an assist on Galchenyuk’s goal to reach double digits this season.
   
52 – Number of points racked up by Max Pacioretty so far this season after picking up an assist against Florida, pushing him past P.K. Subban for the team lead in that category.

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=873837</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (32-31-6) vs. Florida (38-22-9)

TV: RDS, SNE 7:30 p.m.

The Canadiens welcome the Panthers to the Bell Centre Tuesday night, just 24-hours before departing for Buffalo where they will face-off against the Sabres on Wednesday night.  
In the Habs most recent contest on Saturday night against Minnesota, the organization needed to make an emergency recall from St. John’s in order to fill the voids in the lineup left by P.K. Subban (upper-body) and Lars Eller (virus). Blue-liner Mark Barberio would score the lone goal for the Habs, while Darren Dietz, called up to replace Subban, suited up for his first career NHL game in Saturday’s 4-1 loss. 

The Florida Panthers meanwhile arrive in Montreal after taking on the New York Islanders on Monday night. Jonathan Huberdeau and Aleksander Barkov both chipped in with two point nights but the Islanders ultimately came away victorious 3-2. 

As the Panthers will be playing their second game in as many nights, Florida could potentially turn to netminder Al Montoya for Tuesday night’s game in Montreal. In three career starts against the Canadiens, the former first-rounder holds a 2-1-0 record with a .921 save percentage. 

While the Panthers have the upper hand in the season series thus far, the Canadiens will their chances to even the score, as two of the Habs’ final four contests this season are against Florida.</description>

         <description>MONTREAL - For most of us, getting body-checked into a steel goalpost sounds like the very definition of pain, for Nathan Beaulieu however; it’s just part of the job. 

Beaulieu’s scary collision with the woodwork traces back to February 22, 2016, when the Canadiens welcomed the Nashville Predators to Montreal for a Monday night match-up at the Bell Centre. 

With just over five minutes remaining - and with the score deadlocked at one apiece – Beaulieu made a power move towards Pekka Rinne’s crease, only to be sent flying from behind into one of the always unforgiving goalposts. 

“Let’s just say I was fortunate, because it could have been a lot worse. I’ve seen the replay a couple times and it’s just gross to watch. I’m very fortunate that it wasn’t season ending or anything,” admitted Beaulieu, who also gave insight into the moments that followed the alarming impact. “The injury was playable for the first couple of shifts but when we were heading into overtime, I went over to J.J. [Daigneault]and I told him that I could no longer give 100% out there. I wanted to play but I needed to make sure that I didn’t jeopardize the team’s chances of winning.

“Stuff like that happens all the time. You have so much adrenaline going that you don’t know what’s really going on, you just know that you want to play” continued the Strathroy, Ontario native who celebrated his 23rd birthday this past December. “I’m a fighter. I don’t like going down, or staying down, I want to get back up. I knew I would be in good hands with the medical staff but I wanted to at least test it out. The first couple of shifts after really didn’t feel that bad but after that it started to get worse. Once things settled down I knew something wasn’t right.”

As the news of Beaulieu’s injury came directly on the heels of the announcement that regular blue-liners Jeff Petry (sports hernia) and Tom Gilbert (knee) would be require season-ending surgery, the Habs were left with three vacancies on the blue-line to fill.

Fortunately reinforcements from the St. John’s IceCaps - in the form of Mark Barberio, Victor Bartley, Greg Pateryn, Morgan Ellis and Darren Dietz - were quickly called upon to help bolster the Habs blue-line. 

“It was our team picture today and I think almost our entire back row was in St. John’s at one point this season. The injuries this year have been pretty crazy, but it has also been exciting to see the young guys step up. In my career, I also needed opportunities like that to help establish myself,” contributed Beaulieu, who plied his trade for 132 games in the American Hockey League before entrenching himself as a mainstay in coach Therrien’s lineup. “Especially with Subby going down, we are now without three of the defenseman that suited up on opening night. We’ve been banged up basically all season. I honestly haven’t seen anything like it before. It feels like there are 12 guys in the infirmary every day.”

Having already posted new career highs this season in goals, assists, points, hits, blocks and minutes played, it can be easy to forget that the former first-round pick is still adjusting to being an every-day NHLer.

“He’s a young defenseman, that’s still in his first full year in the NHL. For defenseman specifically, it can take more time to prove that you belong in the NHL. We like what we’ve seen so far this year. He’s had his ups and down, just like any player. When we look at our young defensemen, we are looking for quality of play and consistency,” noted coach Therrien, who revealed that Beaulieu is presently considered questionable to play on Tuesday night against the Florida Panthers. 

Tuesday’s contest aside, hitting the ice at the Bell Centre for Monday’s practice was an important step in the right direction for the youngsters rehab and especially for his morale. 
“There are only so many games left and I hate watching so I am just trying my best to get back out there. There’s definitely a chance I’ll play this week. It’s an annoying injury, but that’s all I can really say about it. My progression has been much more positive in the last couple weeks. I’ve been skating with our strength and conditioning coach,” explained the former Saint John Sea Dog, who was forced to watch the entirety of the Canadiens recent road-trip to California from the sidelines. “Joining the guys on the ice for practice today was just the next step in my rehab, but it’s definitely more fun to be out there shooting on a goalie instead of a 2-by-4 stuck to the net. Today was a good step,” concluded the young rearguard.

Beaulieu’s encounter with the pipes, though painful, remind us all of an important hockey lesson; the posts are a goalie’s best friends.

         <description>MONTREAL -- The Minnesota Wild were too much for a depleted Habs lineup to handle on Saturday night.

With 11 regulars off the roster due to either illness or injury, the Canadiens faced a tall task in the Wild, who counted 2,062 additional games of NHL experience in their starting lineup alone.

“Obviously we’re missing a lot of guys, but we’re not using that as an excuse. I don’t think we played our best tonight. They brought it to us and played with more desperation,” acknowledged Mark Barberio, who was named the night’s Third Star in the 4-1 defeat.

Still, the number is hard to ignore.

“I looked around the room this morning in Brossard to do a quick count, and I think there are 10 guys here right now who have suited up for at least one game with the IceCaps this season,” continued the Montreal native. “But it’s great for the young guys to come up and get experience and find out they can play at this level.”

Barberio himself is proof of that philosophy. Since being called up from from St. John’s on December 27, the 25-year-old has steadily come into his own with the Habs.

“When I signed here my goal was to battle for a spot at training camp, but obviously all the injuries have given me the opportunity to play more minutes. When you get an opportunity you just have to try your best to seize it,” added Barberio, who has now racked up four points in his last four games, including the Habs’ lone goal against the Wild. “I feel good about my game, but I’m not trying to change the type of player I am. I was the same type of player in St. John’s -- a puck mover who plays hard defensively. I’m not trying to do too much out there, and as of right now I’m feeling good about it.”

While the team obviously didn’t get the result it was looking for on Saturday night -- dropping a regulation decision at home for the first time since February 3 -- the effort put forth by the young guns did manage to catch the eye of their head coach.

“The line changes tonight brought us some energy, which is what I was looking for. I put [Michael] McCarron on a line with [Lucas] Lessio, who I like a lot -- he’s very dynamic -- and Charles Hudon. They were energetic, and created some scoring chances. Tomas Plekanec’s line did too. The goal was to re-energize our team on the ice, and we were successful in that regard.”

With at least one player with IceCaps experience this season on each of the Habs’ top three lines, the newcomers also had the chance to impress their veteran peers from up close.

“After the start we had, suffering all those injuries to our top guys wasn’t easy, but it happens. It happens to every other team in different years, and it’s a great opportunity for the young guys to step in,” underlined Plekanec, who spent part of the evening playing on a line with Hudon and Paul Byron. “They played really well. A lot of them skated really well. When I was younger I didn’t get as many opportunities like this that they’re getting now.”

Now a 12-year NHL veteran however, the Canadiens’ 71st overall pick from the 2001 NHL Entry Draft did have some words of wisdom -- and encouragement -- for the next generation of Habs.

“They need to focus on their games, and focus on whatever their jobs are,” concluded Plekanec. “They’re young and learning -- like we’ve all been -- but they’re doing a good job.”

         <description>MONTREAL - Here's a numerical look at Saturday night's game against the Minnesota Wild at the Bell Centre. 

274 -- Number of consecutive games P.K. Subban had suited up for prior to missing Saturday night’s action at the Bell Centre. Sitting out a game for the first time since January 30, 2013, the Canadiens’ longest active ironman streak was snapped opposite the Wild.

4 -- Number of remaining Habs who have played in all 69 games so far this season. With Subban out, that list is now comprised of Max Pacioretty, Alex Galchenyuk, Tomas Plekanec, and Andrei Markov.

7 - Number of players on Saturday night’s roster who were also in the lineup for the Canadiens’ season opener on October 7, 2015 at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto -- four forwards (Pacioretty, Plekanec, Galchenyuk and Torrey Mitchell), two defensemen (Markov and Alexei Emelin), and goaltender Mike Condon.

2,062 -- Difference in number of games of NHL experience between Minnesota (3,215) and Montreal's (1,153) starting lineups.

1 -- Number of career NHL games Darren Dietz now has under his belt, after making his Canadiens debut on Saturday. The 22-year-old defenseman was an emergency call-up for the Habs on Friday afternoon.

4 -- Number of points registered by Mark Barberio over the last four games. With his first period goal against the Wild, the Montreal native now sits just one point shy of the career-high 10 he picked up during his 2013-14 season in Tampa -- only this time 21 games sooner.

490 -- Number of days since the Minnesota Wild last visited the Bell Centre -- an emotional night during which the final member of the Canadiens’ legendary Big Three, Guy Lapointe, saw his jersey retired on November 8, 2014.

37 -- Number of hits dished out by the Habs on Saturday night, to just 18 by the Wild. Dietz notably served up four in his NHL debut.

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens vs. Wild</title>

         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (32-30-6) vs. Sabres (27-33-9)

TV: TVAS, SN 7:00 p.m.

Alex Galchenyuk looks to extend his three-game goal scoring streak as the Habs welcome the Minnesota Wild to the Bell Centre on Saturday night.
  
The 22-year-old Galchenyuk, presently the NHL’s hottest scorer, brought the Bell Centre to its feet once more with yet another two goal effort in Thursday night’s 3-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. In the injury department, P.K. Subban has been officially ruled out of Saturday night’s game, meaning his 273 game iron-man streak will be snapped, after the Habs All-Star suffered a neck injury on Thursday night against the Sabres.   

Called up from St. John's on Friday, forward Charles Hudon and defenseman Darren Dietz were both at practice on Saturday morning. Hudon formed a line with Paul Byron and Tomas Plekanec while Dietz was paired with Victor Bartley on the back end.

Lars Eller (flu) and Stefan Matteau (lower body) meanwhile will both miss Saturday's game.

In addition, coach Michel Therrien confirmed that Mike Condon will get the nod again between the pipes after kicking aside 36 of the 38 shots he faced in the win over Buffalo. For the rookie netminder, Saturday’s game marks the 2nd time Condon has squared off against the Minnesota Wild this season. 

At the other end of the ice, netminder Darcy Kuemper could be called upon to defend the Wild’s net as regular starter Devan Dubnyk missed the Wild’s last contest with an illness. The Wild also had an iron-man streak of their own broken, as forward Jason Pominville was forced to sit out Minnesota’s clash against the Oilers on Thursday night, snapping his consecutive games played streak at 231.

The Wild hold a 1-0 advantage over the Habs in the two-game season series between the two teams, after picking up a 2-1 victory back on December 22, 2015.</description>

         <title>Too hot to handle</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=873356</link>
         <description>BROSSARD – Every time Alex Galchenyuk has touched the puck of late, it seems like something good has happened.

On Thursday night, the 22-year-old centerman didn’t miss a beat, registering his third straight multi-goal game in the Canadiens’ 3-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. It marked the fifth time in his last eight games that Galchenyuk had scored twice in a single contest, a feat that hadn’t been accomplished by a Montreal Canadiens player in 57 years. Hall-of-Famer Jean Beliveau was the last man to do it, going on a similar streak between February 28 and March 15, 1959.

Brian Savage, meanwhile, was the last Canadiens player prior to Galchenyuk to string together a three-game multi-goal streak. That was back in October 1995.

With 11 goals in his last eight games – coupled with an astounding 44 percent shooting percentage during that span – Galchenyuk is absolutely dominating opposing netminders and impressing everyone around him in the process. That’s especially true when it comes to head coach Michel Therrien.

“He’s taking advantage of the opportunities he has right now. A lot of credit goes to him with the way he’s developed. He’s not the same player that he was maybe three months ago. We started the year with the intention to give him the opportunity to play on the top two lines as a centerman. We didn’t get the results we were looking for,” said Therrien, who met with members of the media on Friday morning following off-ice workouts at the Bell Sports Complex.

“Even at times when we put Alex with [Max] Pacioretty, it wasn’t a matter of goals or assists or points. They didn’t get any scoring chances when they played together for like three games [earlier this season]. When you see those things, you think he’s probably not ready for that type of role,” added Therrien, who is clearly impressed with Galchenyuk’s remarkable production in recent weeks. “That’s why I’m saying I’ve got to give a lot of credit to Alex. He’s kept on working and working, and now he’s taking advantage of the opportunities he’s being given.”

Flanked by Pacioretty and fellow young gun Sven Andrighetto, Galchenyuk is enjoying unparalleled goal-scoring success and the trio is thriving night after night. Over the last three games, they’ve combined for 15 points and they aren’t showing any sign of slowing down.

“He’s obviously playing really great hockey,” said Andrighetto, who has three assists in his last two games – all of which have come on Galchenyuk markers. “I don’t know if you can get hotter than that. I’m really excited to be playing with him on the same line. He’s at his best right now and we want to keep it going.”

Galchenyuk, who now leads the Canadiens with a career-high 25 goals and ranks fourth on the team with 46 points, fully understands the need to do just that given the club’s ongoing battle to gain some ground in the Eastern Conference playoff race with 14 games to go.

“I’ve definitely never been that hot in the NHL, but like I said after the last game, too, I have to give a lot of credit to my linemates. The first goal was a great set up by Patch and the second goal was a gift from Sven. I give them a lot of praise for that,” said Galchenyuk following Thursday night’s victory at the Bell Centre. “You have to keep going, though. Things get forgotten about really quickly, so you have to stay focused and keep going.”

It’s just that type of mindset that has Therrien believing that Galchenyuk is making important strides in his game every single day.

“I think he’s more mature in his game. He’s going harder to the net. He’s paying more attention to detail. It’s normal to see that curve in a young player. We’re happy about the development that Alex has had over those years,” said Therrien. “I believe we just saw some of the results that come with the patience, teaching and hard work that Alex has done. As far as I’m concerned, it’s just another step in the right direction.”

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=873139</link>
         <description>MONTREAL – The Habs won the game on Thursday night, but they also suffered a major loss.

Prior to puck drop against the Sabres, P.K. Subban was joined at center ice by Elise Beliveau, who was on hand to present the 26-year-old assistant captain with the trophy named in her late husband’s honor. Subban had earned the 2015-16 Jean Beliveau Trophy through his commitment to the community, in no small part thanks to a pledge he made in September to help raise $10 million for the Montreal Children’s Hospital over the next seven years. 

Subban went on to play 29:55 against Buffalo, including an enormous 6:57 with the man advantage, collecting his career-high 45th assist of the season by chipping in with a helper on Alex Galchenyuk’s second-period power play marker. He landed three shots on goal and attempted four others in addition to blocking three Sabres’ shots at the other end of the ice. 

Then, with 2:26 remaining in the third period with the Habs up 3-2 in the game, Subban was reaching to poke the puck away from Marcus Foligno in the Canadiens’ zone when he suffered an unfortunate collision with teammate, Alexei Emelin. After being tended to by the team’s medical staff, Subban was eventually carted off on a stretcher, but not before managing to flash a “thumbs up” to the crowd as he left the ice. 

“Every time the doctors rush onto the ice, we’re worried. When it takes a long time and the player ends up leaving on a stretcher, there’s always worry,” said head coach Michel Therrien, whose star defensemen was taken to the hospital to undergo further testing after the game. “When I went to see him, he was with the doctors. I had a good talk with them and they assured me that he had movement in his extremities, which is a good thing given the circumstances.” 

This isn’t the first time in recent history that the Bell Centre faithful has held its collective breath as a Canadiens player was stretchered off the ice with a neck injury. Nearly five years ago to the day, on March 8, 2011, Max Pacioretty lay motionless on the ice for an extended period after being hit into a stanchion by Zdeno Chara. He left that game with a concussion and broken vertebrae, and on Thursday, the emotions immediately came flooding back to the Habs’ captain.

“I’ve been in that position before and it brings back a lot of tough memories. It was really hard to watch,” admitted Pacioretty, who won the 2012 Masterton Trophy after bouncing back from his injury and potting 33 goals the following season. “It was impossible to concentrate after that. Maybe for me more so than other guys. Now I know how guys felt when that happened to me. All we can do is be supportive. Any time you get an injury to that area, it’s very, very scary.

“Most of the time they just have to be careful when it comes to that, though, so we’re hoping for the best,” he added. “I actually one time bumped [Johnny] Boychuk and they brought out the board and it ended up just being back spasms and he ended up travelling home with the team. I think it’s more seeing that and seeing the building quiet and seeing all those doctors on the ice that upset me. This is a sport and it comes second. Any time something scary like that happens, it’s ok to be emotional about it.”

The Canadiens managed to rally for the remaining two-and-a-half minutes of action to earn another two points in the standings. Galchenyuk continued his torrid scoring pace, registering a third-straight multi-goal night to earn first star honors against the Sabres. He became just the 16th player in franchise history to score 25 goals in a season before celebrating his 23rd birthday and now sits atop the team’s leaderboard for goals, but with the way the night ended, scoring streaks were the furthest thing from Galchenyuk’s mind. 

“When one of your friends is like that, it’s really difficult. Even right now, you don’t have many words, you just hope he’s ok and pray for the best,” shared Galchenyuk. “It was definitely tough. It’s a good thing there were only two minutes left. It’s a tough thing to go through and you just pray for the best. Everyone on the team is thinking about him right now and we all just hope he’s ok.”

         <description>MONTREAL - Here's a numerical look at Thursday night's game against the Buffalo Sabres at the Bell Centre. 

7 – Number of annual Radio Telethons hosted by the Montreal Canadiens Children’s Foundation over the years, with the 2016 edition having taken place during the Habs-Sabres game at the Bell Centre on Thursday night. 

5 – Number of times Max Pacioretty has fired 250 or more shots in a single season in his career, hitting the milestone for a fifth time after 68 games in 2015-16 following his seven-shot performance against Buffalo.

9 – Number of seconds needed by Galchenyuk to reply for the Habs after Nicolas Deslauriers opened the scoring for the visitors, lighting the lamp while Bell Centre PA announcer Michel Lacroix was still announcing the Sabres’ goal 9:09 into the second frame.

66 – Number of players now appearing on Brown’s career NHL fight card after the gritty forward added Deslauriers to that list with his second-period scrap on Thursday night. 
    
7 – Number of multi-goal games enjoyed by Galchenyuk so far this season, having now done so five times in the last eight games following his two-goal effort against Buffalo. 

16 – Number of players in franchise history who have realized a 25-goal season for the Canadiens before celebrating their 23rd birthday, with Galchenyuk adding his name to that list by becoming the first Hab to do so since Andrei Kostitsyn in 2007-08. 

45 – Number of assists racked up by P.K. Subban so far this season, setting a new career high in that category after picking up a helper on Galchenyuk’s second goal of the game.

         <title>The Jean Béliveau Trophy awarded to P.K. Subban</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=873075</link>
         <description>PRESS RELEASE

MONTREAL - The recipient of the Jean Béliveau trophy for the 2015-16 season will be honored during a short ceremony before the game between the Buffalo Sabres and the Montreal Canadiens tonight at the Bell Centre. On that occasion, Canadiens defenseman P.K. Subban will be presented with the award for his charitable actions and community involvement. 

The selection committee, consisting of members of the Board of Directors of the Montreal Canadiens Children’s Foundation, evaluated candidates according to their commitment, enthusiasm, implication and time invested in collective and personal initiatives. Candidates were also judged on their leadership and financial contribution to the causes they chose to support.   

P.K. Subban’s community actions mostly revolve around his $10 million pledge over a 7-year period to the Montreal Children’s Hospital Foundation, announced last September. Committed to giving back to the Montreal community, he chose to concentrate his efforts around the cause of sick children and families who benefit from the care and services of the Montreal Children’s Hospital. Since this announcement, Subban has participated in various fundraising initiatives, such as the Winter Classic jersey sale and signing, the Twitter campaign to support P.K.’s Helping Hand as well as a Holiday matching gift campaign. These efforts, combined with his own personal financial contribution and that of the P.K. Subban Foundation, helped raise in excess of $820,000 to date for the Montreal Children’s Hospital Foundation. P.K. Subban is also a regular visitor to the Hospital, acts as ambassador and has joined the Board of Directors of the Foundation.

One of P.K.’s greatest assets is his capacity to use his personality and his enthusiasm to rally the public around the projects he supports. A man of his time, P.K. shines on social media, multiplying his initiatives to raise awareness, reach out to individuals and engage the community. The press conference announcing his $10 million pledge provided the Hospital and its Foundation with tremendous exposure, with media coverage from coast to coast, throughout the United States and all the way to Europe. It also significantly increased their Instagram and Twitter followers and Facebook community. The video of P.K.’s Winter Wonderland surprise party, organized in collaboration with the Air Canada Foundation, for 50 young patients and their families did much to raise awareness about the cause of sick children.

The Jean Béliveau trophy is awarded annually to the Canadiens player who best exemplifies leadership qualities in the community. The award is accompanied by a $25,000 donation from the Montreal Canadiens Children’s Foundation which P.K. Subban chose to give to the Montreal Children’s Hospital Foundation in support of the P.K.’s Helping Hand program.

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens vs. Sabres</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=873037</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (31-30-6) vs. Sabres (27-32-9)

TV: RDS, SN, SN360 7:30 p.m.

The Sabres and Canadiens are set two square off twice in the span of just six days, with the first match-up taking place on Thursday night at the Bell Centre. 

The Bell Centre faithful had plenty to cheer about in the Canadiens most recent game on Tuesday night against the Dallas Stars. The crowd was brought to its feet when Phillip Danault scored his first goal as a Montreal Canadien, only to rise once more when Alex Galchenyuk scored the eventual overtime winner.  

Meanwhile, the Sabres arrived in Montreal following a 4-2 loss to the New York Rangers on Tuesday night. After the Rangers jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the second period, the Sabres attempted to mount a second half comeback with goals from Sam Reinhart and Johan Larsson, only to fall short. 

Coach Michel Therrien confirmed that Mike Condon will get the nod between the pipes against the Sabres, after Ben Scrivens guided the Habs to Tuesday’s win over the Stars. In two career starts against Buffalo, the rookie goaltender holds a 1-2-0 record with a 2.69 goals against average and a .913 save percentage. 

In the injury department, Lars Eller is questionable to play Thursday night after sporting a non-contact jersey in Wednesday morning’s practice in Brossard. 

Thursday night’s contest comes with just five points separating the Canadiens and Sabres in the Eastern Conference standings.</description>

         <title>Notebook: March 9 - Practice</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=872911</link>
         <description>BROSSARD - Alex Galchenyuk’s overtime winner - the perfectly placed one-timer that brought the 21,286 spectators at the Bell Centre to their feet – was just one of the many highlights from Tuesday’s thriller. 

A NEW TRIO IN TOWN: In response to the latest batch of injuries, coach Therrien returned to the drawing board where he constructed a new top line featuring Alex Galchenyuk back at center in between Max Pacioretty and Sven Andrighetto. 

“I’m really pleased with the way the team has competed the last few games. I thought our line definitely played well. Right now we’re in the midst of an evaluation period, so for us to be at our best we need to keep improving every game. We’ve had fun playing together the last three games. As a line we just have to keep getting better and better and hopefully we can step up and take on even more responsibility,” stated captain Max Pacioretty, who has collected four points in his last two games alongside his new line-mates Galchenyuk and Andrighetto. “Sven’s got the skill to play anywhere in the lineup, but when he gets the opportunity to make plays and get some good ice time, he’s going to take advantage of it. I think he’s done a good job of that this year. When he first got called up he had a couple spurts like that. For a player of that caliber, at a young age it is important to prove that they can be a consistent NHLer.”

MAKING SOME NOISE: Galchenyuk’s game-winning-goal wasn’t the only moment to send Habs fans into a frenzy, as recently acquired Phillip Danault scored his first career goal in a Montreal Canadiens uniform. The goal was just the second marker of the 23-year-old’s career, making Tuesday night a memorable one for the Canadiens rookie.

“I had butterflies in my stomach before the game, but the fans were just so amazing. It was an incredible feeling to score and hear the crowd cheer my name,” admitted Danault, who also revealed that both he and his phone were buzzing with excitement. “I received several text messages, it was really nice to see the support of everyone, I really appreciated it. I hold that memory in the same category as my first NHL goal [which occurred earlier this year with the Chicago Blackhawks]. I thought I played better last game but I’m never quite satisfied. I can’t say I’ve been perfect but I can say that I am constantly working hard to improve.  After I scored that goal last night I was able to relax a bit and just tell myself ‘Okay, you can settle down now.’”

GOOD NEWS EVERYONE: The good news keeps coming as Lars Eller – presently sidelined with a ‘mid-body’ injury -  was back with his teammates at Wednesday morning’s practice in Brossard, albeit while sporting a baby blue non-contact jersey. A durable player over the course of his seven-year NHL career, Eller had previously suited up for all 66 games this season before he was forced to sit out Tuesday night’s affair against Dallas.

“I feel good, I’ve been progressing every day. I can’t say when I will return for sure but I can say that things are moving in the right direction.  The injury occurred during our last road trip, I guess you could call it a mid-body injury. It’s not a long-term thing, more of a day-to-day situation right now,” provided Eller, who pundits would agree, was playing some of his best hockey prior to suffering the ‘mid-body’ injury.  

“I’ll know more about my status tomorrow, but I felt better today than I did yesterday. I felt I was doing a lot of good things out on the ice recently, ever since I was moved back to center at some point in January. I’ve been feeling really good about my game lately, regardless of who I am playing with.  I feel like I was on a long and consistent run of good hockey, so it’s not fun to sit on the sidelines. I hope it won’t take long to get back to that form, I’ve only missed one game. Like I said I really see this as a day-to-day thing, I’ve been skating every day except for two off-days. It shouldn’t be an issue.”
NO EXCUSES: As noted by captain Pacioretty, the Canadiens are not willing to take a single game lightly as the 2015-16 season winds down. 

“This is a hockey team that doesn’t accept failure. We don’t know what’s going to happen the rest of the year or in the summer but you know through tough times like this you want to show what you are made of; both mentally and physically. Show that we have what it takes to be Montreal Canadiens.”

Though he only has one game of Bell Centre experience to his credit, Stefan Matteau - the newest member of the Canadiens roster – echoed his captain’s sentiments.

“Nobody here wants to give up. No player in the league, even if you are in first or last place, wants to give up. We are all professionals and we take every game seriously. Yesterday we knew we were in tough against a very good team, so we knew we’d have to be at our very best,” concluded Matteau.

As the son of an 848-game NHL veteran, the youngster quickly became accustomed to the sights and sounds of a national hockey league game, however, as the 22-year-old would certainly attest after last night, nothing quite compares to the roar of the Bell Centre faithful.

         <description>MONTREAL -- Chucky continues to be scary good for the Habs.

With nine goals in his last seven games -- that’s an eye-popping average of 1.28 goals per game over that span -- Alex Galchenyuk is on fire right now.

Tallying his fourth multi-goal night since February 24 -- the exciting forward previously counted just five over the course of his career prior to that -- Galchenyuk was fittingly named the first star in a 4-3 overtime win over the Dallas Stars on Tuesday.

“He’s a different player than the one he was at the start of the season. You want to give your players chances, but you don’t want them to forget who they are. That’s why we put him on the wing for awhile -- so he could find his game again. We knew he would play center eventually. Often things come down to a question of timing, and right now the timing -- and the performances -- are good. I don’t regret waiting because it was important for him to grow into the role,” explained head coach Michel Therrien, who initially made Galchenyuk his first line center on Saturday in Winnipeg.

That move was rewarded with a two-goal outing in which the 22-year-old was the team’s most utilized forward in Manitoba. On Tuesday, the Milwaukee, WI native topped that by adding an overtime-winner and an assist into the mix.

“He’s been playing with a lot of confidence since a month ago, and we felt like he was confident enough to test at center again. We didn’t want him to lose his offensive instincts. He’s playing well on both sides of the ice right now, and he’s proving that he’s capable of doing so,” continued the Habs’ bench boss. “We’ve seen some positive flashes in the past, but now we’re seeing the steady quality of play we’ve been looking for.”

The former third-overall pick from the 2012 NHL Draft insists that should come as no surprise, especially considering the company he’s keeping on the top line.

“We tried [pairing myself with Max Pacioretty] a couple of times before, but this time I wanted to make sure we got things going,” underlined Galchenyuk, who picked up an assist on the Canadiens captain’s first-period tally. “He’s without a doubt the best winger on our team, and I see no reason why we shouldn’t click. I’m just trying to adjust my game and he’s still adjusting his, but he’s so fast and powerful with such a great release, that we’ve got to go out there and make it work.”

The team’s goal-scoring leader returned the kind words.

“He’s confident. When we’re holding the puck and making plays we’re able to play some big minutes. His patience right now obviously comes with confidence, but it gives us the ability to make plays and it gives us more ice time because we’re not chasing the puck,” praised Pacioretty, who now sits just one goal ahead of Galchenyuk for the team lead with 24. “He’s hot. Our whole team had fun tonight. We’re a hardworking group, and it was nice to see Alex rewarded.”

With multi-goal performances coming against some of the League’s top teams in Washington, Anaheim and Dallas over the past two weeks, the young forward meanwhile has just one goal in mind down the stretch.

“I don’t come into games thinking about [playing a starring role], but I do put pressure on myself to go out there and create success for my teammates. It’s an honor, and I take it very seriously,” concluded Galchenyuk. “I’m focused and I want to keep it going.”

         <title>The Numbers Game: March 8, 2016</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=872667</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - Here's a numerical look at Tuesday night's game against the Dallas Stars at the Bell Centre. 

5 -- Number of Habs who have played all 67 games so far this season. Max Pacioretty, Alex Galchenyuk, Tomas Plekanec, P.K. Subban and Andrei Markov saw their numbers in that category take a hit on Tuesday as Lars Eller missed his first outing of the year with a lower body injury.

115 -- Number of consecutive games Eller had played prior to missing Tuesday’s action -- good for the third-longest ironman streak on the current roster, behind just Plekanec (154) and Subban (272).

2 -- Number of Habs who made their Bell Centre debuts for the home side opposite the Stars. Stefan Matteau and Mike Brown both took their first strides in Montreal after being acquired at the NHL trade deadline on February 29.

11 -- Number of games separating Galchenyuk’s two most recent assists. Galchenyuk’s first-period helper to Pacioretty was the first since February 9 for the forward who has been enjoying impressive offensive production of late.

1.29 -- Number of goals per game Galchenyuk has averaged since February 24. With his second-period tally on Tuesday, the 22-year-old now counts nine in his last seven outings.

00:36 -- Number of seconds separating the second period’s first and second goals on Tuesday night. Montreal and Dallas exchanged a pair of early markers in the middle frame’s opening minute, as Jason Spezza gave the Stars a short-lived 2-1 lead at 00:17 before Galchenyuk replied with the equalizer at 00:53.

6 -- Number of games it took newcomer Phillip Danault to score his first goal as a Hab. The Victoriaville, QC native lit the lamp before the home crowd just over a week after earning his first point as a Hab, on February 29 in San Jose.

9 -- Number of hits dished out by Mike Brown against the Stars on Tuesday night, leading all players across both teams in that category.

         <title>IceCaps report – March 8</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=872662</link>
         <description>The Montreal Canadiens have a new farm team this season, the St. John's IceCaps. To help Canadiens fans track the team's performance in the AHL, we have invited Charles Dart, website contributor of the IceCaps' official website to prepare a bi-weekly summary of the action in Newfoundland.

ST. JOHN’S – The Calder Cup Playoff race is down to the final stretch as the St. John’s IceCaps have just 17 games remaining before the postseason commences in the third week of April.

With the new playoff qualification rules this year, the IceCaps must finish in the top two of the North Division standings to be guaranteed a playoff spot, or have the highest or second- highest winning percentage among the remaining Eastern Conference teams (*3N, 4N, or 5A).

St. John’s currently sits fifth in the North Division with a .517 winning % (25-23-8-3).

The IceCaps picked up three of four points this past weekend at home against the Albany Devils. Sylvain Lefebvre’s team is 15 points behind the Devils for second place in the North Division, and just 7 points behind the Utica Comets for third spot.

“It’s a big point tonight,” said Lefebvre following Saturday night’s 5-4 OT loss. “Our margin of error is not very big and we want to get as many wins as possible, so now we have to refocus and get ready for Bingo [Binghamton Senators].”

Russian rookie Nikita Scherbak has been hot of late, recording six points (1G, 5A) in his past five games, including the first multi-point night of his career with a goal and two assists in Saturday’s contest. Scherbak has compiled 12 points (5G, 7A) since returning to the lineup from injury on January 16th.

Bud Holloway has reached 50 points on the season and is 11 points shy of his season-high record of 61 set back in 2010-2011. 

Charles Hudon sits at 19 goals on the year, tying his season-high from last year with 17 games left to play. Hudon recorded 57 points last season and has 41 entering tonight’s action. 

Morgan Ellis will draw back into the lineup for the first time since February 26th. He remains the IceCaps leading scorer on the back end (31 PTS) and the team plus-minus leader at +8, too. He sits second among all AHL defensemen with 12 goals, and should add even more firepower to the IceCaps’ fourth-ranked power play on home ice (22.7%). St. John’s also has the second-place penalty kill on the road at 86.3%.

The Binghamton Senators (7th, North Division) and Hershey Bears (1st, Atlantic Division) visit St. John’s this week and will wrap up the IceCaps’ six-game home stand this Sunday, March 13th.

St. John’s and Binghamton will get going at 6:00 PM EST tonight and tomorrow night, before battling the Bears Saturday night and Sunday evening.

St. John’s will then go on their final road trip – a crucial seven-game swing where they will face the Utica Comets (3rd, North), Syracuse Crunch (6th, North), Rochester Americans (4th, North), and Toronto Marlies (1st, North).

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens vs. Stars</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=872548</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (30-30-6) vs. Stars (40-20-7)

TV: RDS, SNE 7:30 p.m.

The Canadiens get back on home ice on Tuesday night, when they welcome the Dallas Stars to the Bell Centre. 

On Saturday night in Winnipeg, another two-goal performance by Alex Galchenyuk evened the score at 2-2 in the third period, before the Jets eventually went on to a 4-2 victory thanks to a hat-trick from Mark Scheifele. 

In the Stars camp, Lindy Ruff’s troops closed out last week with back-to-back victories over the Devils and Senators to maintain hold of the third seed in the Western Conference playoff picture. Seeing as netminder Kari Lehtonen guided his team to both wins over Ottawa and New Jersey, the 32-year-old is likely to be back between the pipes on Tuesday night in Montreal. 

The Canadiens confirmed that netminder Ben Scrivens will get the nod against the Stars after Mike Condon kicked aside 26 of the 29 shots he faced in Saturday night’s loss to the Jets. Moreover, the club also announced that recently acquired Stefan Matteau will make his Bell Centre debut on Tuesday night. 

In the injury department, Brendan Gallagher will not suit up on Tuesday night after suffering a lower-body injury in the Canadiens last game against Winnipeg on Saturday. In addition, the team confirmed that Alex Galchenyuk will indeed be in the lineup while Lars Eller (upper-body) will be a game-time decision after both were absent from Monday morning's practice. 

Tuesday night’s contest marks the last time the two teams meet this season, as the Stars picked up two points in the standings in the first match-up back on December 19, 2015.</description>

         <title>Fountain of youth</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=872546</link>
         <description>BROSSARD - With a large number of regulars currently missing from Michel Therrien’s lineup, a youth movement has begun to step up and help carry the torch in Montreal.  

As the likes of Carey Price, Brendan Gallagher, Nathan Beaulieu, Jeff Petry, David Desharnais, Tom Gilbert, Brian Flynn and Daniel Carr are presently nursing injuries, the door has opened for the younger and less experienced Habs to take advantage of the opportunity. 

Moreover, you can temporarily add Alex Galchenyuk and Lars Eller’s names to the list of the walking wounded, as the pair of forwards are both questionable to suit up for Tuesday night’s contest against the Stars. 

Luckily, the emergence of rookie center Michael McCarron should help soften the blow. 

“I feel a bit more comfortable, and I’ve been getting more accustomed to the guys in the room and the speed of the game. I think anybody would say that the difference between the NHL and the AHL is the speed. Everybody also makes perfect passes; every play is crisp and perfect,” said the birthday boy, who celebrated his 21st birthday with an intense hour-long practice at the Bell Sports Complex in Brossard. “My goal is to stay here as long as I can. I just need to continue to improve and progress and stick to my style of play.” 

Standing at 6’6”, the now 21-year-old can do more than just handle himself when it comes to dropping the gloves. However, the Habs former first-round draft pick also has the skill set required be a productive scorer in the NHL. 

 “I don’t go out there thinking about fighting. I’m not just a fighter; I can produce offensively as well. Everybody on this team is capable of chipping in offensively. I think I’ve had some good chances but I haven’t managed to bury them. I just need to keep going because if you get enough chances you are going to produce,” noted the former 2015 Memorial Cup winner with the OHL’s Oshawa Generals. “I think the guys in the NHL might be a bit stronger but it is more or less the same physically. Guys in the AHL are always fighting to get a shot in the NHL. It is almost easier to play in the NHL because your teammates are so good and rarely make mistakes.”

While the seemingly endless amount of injuries have made it difficult for coach Therrien’s line formations to build chemistry, the Habs bench boss has been impressed with the contributions of his youth core, including McCarron, and his new line-mate Stefan Matteau.

“McCarron has been playing at a faster pace than what we saw in his first call up and during training camp. He’s a smart player that is good at protecting the puck down low and is a physical presence in front of the net. This is why we have given him time on the power play. 
He can be tough to deal with in the blue paint. He has progressed very well since he was drafted. He’s been great for us at center, especially on face-offs and is a physical guy that defends his teammates if necessary,” encouraged Therrien, who also had high praises for 22-year-old Stefan Matteau. “There is a lot to like. I see Matteau as a power-ford who finishes his checks hard. I liked the chemistry he generated when paired with McCarron last game. We have the chance to truly evaluate the play of our young players. With all of the injuries at the moment, kids like Stefan have a great chance to prove themselves.” 

In addition, Greg Pateryn - one of the blue-liners tasked with stepping up in the face of adversity - looked very comfortable in his new top-4 role, skating a season-high 21:45 alongside defense partner Alexei Emelin in Saturday night’s game against the Jets. 

“I think I’ve taken a stride forward every game. With the opportunity I have been given, I think that’s what everyone is looking for.  When you get a chance to get out there and play, I think you need to take full advantage of that opportunity. I feel like I’ve done a good job. The more you play the better you get. The same goes for everyone. The more you play the more engaged you are,” noted Pateryn, who has also gone on to post new career highs in games played, assists, points, penalty minutes and shots on goal. “Emi [Alexei Emelin] plays a very simple game and so do I. So I think we do a good job of communicating and we are both able to read off of each other.  I enjoy playing with him, we keep it pretty simple and I think it’s effective,” concluded Pateryn. 

With the Habs entering the final stretch of the regular season, the development of the team’s youth movement will continue to be under the microscope, especially considering over half of the Canadiens’ active roster is 25-years-old or younger.

         <description>WINNIPEG - Here's a numerical look at Saturday night's game against the Jets in Winnipeg.

912 – Number of games Andrei Markov has played in a Canadiens uniform, including Saturday night’s tilt against the Jets at the MTS Centre in Winnipeg. Markov joins Guy Carbonneau in 10th spot on the Canadiens’ all-time games played list. Henri Richard leads the way with 1,256 games played in the bleu-blanc-rouge.

40 – Number of starts Mike Condon has made so far during the 2015-16 campaign, including Saturday night’s contest in Manitoba. The 25-year-old netminder hit that mark for the second time in his professional career after starting 47 games last season with the AHL’s Hamilton Bulldogs.

0 – Number of times referees Dave Jackson and Dan O’Halloran had to blow their respective whistles during the opening frame to call a penalty on Saturday night, as both the Canadiens and Jets played disciplined hockey despite combining to dish out 36 hits through 20 minutes of play.

7 – Number of shifts Brendan Gallagher had during Saturday night’s contest before being forced to leave the game in the first period due to a lower-body injury.

8 – Number of players in Canadiens history who, at the age of 22, had already amassed two seasons of 20 goals or more. Alex Galchenyuk joined that select group on Saturday night by scoring in the second period. It also includes the likes of Stephane Richer, Guy Lafleur and Bernard Geoffrion.

29 – Percentage of games Michael McCarron has played in the NHL ranks in which he’s registered at least five shots on goal, including Saturday night’s contest in Manitoba. McCarron had already put five shots on Jets netminder Ondrej Pavelec through 40 minutes of play.

195 – Number of hits Alexei Emelin has dished out so far this season, continuing to build on that tally on Saturday night by throwing his weight around to the tune of five more hits against Winnipeg.

3 – Number of multi-goal games Alex Galchenyuk has registered in his last six games, accomplishing the feat once again on Saturday night with a two-goal performance at the MTS Centre.

         <title>Notebook – March 5</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=872266</link>
         <description>WINNIPEG – In Saturday night’s post-game notebook, Alex Galchenyuk continues to impress, the Canadiens’ road woes continue, and evaluating new talent.

TEARING IT UP: While the Canadiens’ struggles continue, Alex Galchenyuk is playing some of his best hockey right now. On Saturday night, the 22-year-old registered his third multi-goal effort in his last six games, lighting the lamp twice with his 20th and 21st goals of the 2015-16 campaign. That’s a new career-high in the goal-scoring department for the Canadiens’ No. 27, who was featured at center on a line with Max Pacioretty and Brendan Gallagher.

“I felt pretty comfortable, to be honest. I think as a line we created some chances,” said Galchenyuk, who reached the 20-goal plateau for the second straight year in Saturday night’s 4-2 defeat at the MTS Centre. “But, it’s tough losing another close game. It’s been a really difficult road trip for us. We played some great teams. It’s disappointing coming home like that.”

Galchenyuk’s first tally of the night came off a remarkable pass from captain Max Pacioretty, who managed to find his linemate with a no-look pass between his legs just beyond Ondrej Pavelec’s goal crease. 
The goal squared things up 1-1 in the second period just 73 seconds after Winnipeg had taken the lead courtesy of Mark Scheifele – who went on to score a hat-trick in Winnipeg’s victory.

“It was a tremendous play,” admitted Galchenyuk, who tied things up a second time at the 9:44 mark of the final frame, tipping a Greg Pateryn point shot past Pavelec to make it 2-2. “Max had the puck and I was calling for it. He made no mistake. It was a great no-look pass by him. It was a nice play. I definitely give a lot of props to him.”

That being said, Galchenyuk isn’t taking pleasure in lighting the lamp in losing efforts. 

“At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how you perform. You try to perform your best for the team to win. It’s unfortunate that we came up so short,” said Galchenyuk, who ranks fourth on the Canadiens with 41 points in 66 games.  “At the same time, you’ve got to perform until the end. As a line and as offensive players, we’ve got to give our team a chance to create and go put up numbers out there. We’ve got to keep continuing to do that and give our team a chance to win.”

ROAD WOES: The Canadiens picked up just one out of a possible eight points on their four-game road trip that included stops in San Jose, Anaheim, Los Angeles, and finally Winnipeg on Saturday night. It was a tough trek, to say the least. While three out of the four games were relatively close, the Canadiens still couldn’t find a way to pull any of them out in the end.

“They’re great teams. They play hard. They executed well,” said Galchenyuk, referencing the Canadiens’ most recent Western Conference opponents. “There’s not much difference [between us and them] because you look at the games and they’re so close. It’s one and two-goal games. We could have won every game, except the San Jose one which wasn’t as close. The others were pretty tight games and it’s unfortunate.”

Given the way things played out in California and Manitoba over the last week, Michel Therrien’s troops are – without a doubt – looking forward to spending some quality time back home where they’ve compiled a 17-11-3 record since the start of the year. 

“It’s going to be nice to get home,” said Pacioretty, who will lead the Canadiens up against the Dallas Stars, Buffalo Sabres, Minnesota Wild and Florida Panthers before hitting the road again. “These weren’t the results that we wanted. We had a couple of really good efforts. Tonight was definitely a really good effort, in my mind. We battled back and forth with them right until the end. We’ve just got to keep at this.”

TAKING A GOOD LOOK: When general manager Marc Bergevin addressed the media in San Jose following the trade deadline, he made it clear that the Canadiens would spend the remainder of the regular season evaluating their assets, especially their young guns. They had seven players in their lineup on Saturday night with 50 games or less of NHL experience on their resumes, so Michel Therrien is making the most of the opportunity to see the likes of Michael McCarron, Stefan Matteau and Sven Andrighetto ply their trade against some of the league’s top teams.

“Right now, I’m pretty much in evaluation mode with a lot of players,” said Therrien. “I think a guy like Galchenyuk has responded really well to the call. There are a few other young guys that we’re putting in some tough positions, too. Given that we have so many rookies in the lineup, I’m looking more in terms of evaluation than actual results. I’m really focusing on the way our young guys are performing.”

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens @ Jets</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=872154</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (30-29-6) vs. Jets (26-32-5)

TV: TVAS, SN 7:00 p.m.

The Canadiens close out their four-game Western Conference road trip with a Saturday night contest against the Jets in Winnipeg. 

On Thursday night in Los Angeles, a late third period goal from Lars Eller would narrow the Kings lead to 3-2, but the Pacific Division leading Kings would eventually hold on to earn their 38th victory of the season. Defense partners P.K. Subban and Andrei Markov both chipped in with two points apiece in the loss. 

At the morning skate, Alex Galchenyuk was featured at center on a line with Max Pacioretty and Brendan Gallagher. Meanwhile, it appears that Sven Andrighetto will be back in the Canadiens' lineup after being a healthy scratch against Los Angeles.

In the Jets camp, the team is hoping Saturday night’s match-up against the Habs will help them forget their frustrating 4-3 loss to the New York Islanders on Thursday night. As the Jets held a late third-period lead only to watch Anders Lee tie the game up with just 29 seconds remaining, before Kyle Okposo sealed the victory for the Islanders in overtime. 

In the Canadiens crease, netminder Mike Condon is expected back in goal after Ben Scrivens got the call on Thursday night against Los Angeles. The rookie defeated the Jets in his first career start against Winnipeg earlier this season. 
 
The Jets, meanwhile, will counter with Ondrej Pavelec between the pipes.

The Habs hold the edge in the season series after picking up a 5-1 victory in their first and only match-up against the Jets back on November 1, 2015.</description>

         <description>LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles Kings’ brand of hard-hitting, in-your-face type hockey didn’t give the Canadiens much of anything to work with on Thursday night.

Playing their fourth game in six nights, Michel Therrien’s troops dropped a 3-2 decision at the STAPLES Center to a club that relishes making their opponents pay at every conceivable opportunity to throw their weight around. That proved to be the difference in the Canadiens’ second contest in Southern California in as many days, as Darryl Sutter’s squad didn’t let up in the physicality department all night long.

“Tonight was definitely the toughest situation. I think we really left it all out there last night [in Anaheim]. We played a very strong game against a very physical team. It was an emotional battle. Then, we came in tonight and we were very slow off the start,” said captain Max Pacioretty, referencing the Kings’ establishing a 2-0 lead just over three-and-half-minutes into the game on goals by forwards Anze Kopitar and Tanner Pearson.

“They’re one of the best teams in the league for a reason. I can’t remember a time when I had the puck and I didn’t get hit tonight,” added Pacioretty, whose squad was outhit by a 39-24 margin on Thursday night. “Their D-men really play the right way. You don’t notice them that much because of it. They step up and do what’s best for the team. They make the hit, take the hit, and get rid of the puck. That’s very tough to play against. I think that’s Western Conference hockey.”

Milan Lucic and Luke Schenn – both of whom are quite familiar with the Canadiens from having spent time in the Eastern Conference – dished out a team-leading six hits each during the tilt. Greg Pateryn and Mike Brown responded for the CH with five hits apiece, but the Canadiens simply couldn’t match the way the league’s most physical and defensively savvy team went about its business following a three-day break.

“They came out hard. These were three physical games. They were really physically demanding. Tonight, there was no space out there. You know why that team has had so much success both this year and in the past. They just take away your time and space. Going up against Kopitar and [Drew] Doughty, it felt like there was no room out there,” admitted Pacioretty, who registered two of the Canadiens’ season-low 15 shots on goal on Thursday night. “You’re going along the boards against them and you know you’re getting hit. We countered that with some physical play, but like everybody knows, they’re a physical team.”

P.K. Subban can certainly attest to that, having spent just under 29 minutes on the ice playing against the likes of some of the Kings’ toughest customers.

“You’ve got to give them credit. They play a hard, heavy game. They forecheck hard. They make it tough on you coming out of your zone. It was tough for us to come out of our zone tonight,” shared Subban, who scored his sixth goal of the season late in the first period, before reaching the 50-point plateau for a third consecutive year by picking up an assist on Lars Eller’s tally with 5:54 remaining in regulation time.

Like Subban, Therrien was quick to give the Kings’ credit for playing a style of hockey that steadily grinds opponents down as the game goes on.

“We can’t really take anything away from our team. We didn’t match their energy level. It wasn’t the same. Without looking for excuses, you can’t forget that we’ve played four games in the last six nights and we were playing a team that hadn’t played since Sunday,” said Therrien, who will lead the Canadiens into Winnipeg on Saturday night to wrap up their current four-game road swing. “When you’re playing a team like that and you’ve got the same energy level as they do, they’re already tough to play against. They’re the best defensive team in the league and I felt that the energy level just wasn’t there for us.”

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=871988</link>
         <description>LOS ANGELES - Here's a numerical look at Thursday night's game against the Kings in Los Angeles.

19 – Number of games Ben Scrivens played in a Los Angeles Kings uniform during the 2013-14 campaign. Scrivens started against his former club on Thursday night at Staples Center.

5 – Number of games Mike Brown has played against the Kings alone this season, including Thursday night’s tilt in Los Angeles. Brown saw the Kings quite a bit as a member of the San Jose Sharks before being claimed off waivers by the Canadiens at the trade deadline. 

10:04 – Time that elapsed in the opening frame before Michel Therrien’s troops managed to put Kings netminder Jonathan Quick to the test. Torrey Mitchell registered the Canadiens’ first shot on goal with a little over 10 minutes remaining in the first period.

16 – Number of goals the Canadiens have scored this season in which the defensive duo of P.K. Subban and Andrei Markov have both been involved. On Thursday night, Markov set up Subban perfectly for a slap shot that beat Quick late in the opening frame.

94 – Number of points Andrei Markov has managed to amass over the course of his career in the month of March alone, his most productive month of the year. The Russian rearguard picked up his 32nd assist of the season on Subban’s tally in Los Angeles.

21.3 – Percentage of the points the Canadiens have picked up this season that were amassed by defensemen P.K. Subban (50) and Andrei Markov (37), with the pair accounting for 87 of the 408 points the team has managed to put up since early October.

5 – Number of times over the course of his NHL career that Greg Pateryn has dished out five hits or more in the same night. Pateryn did just that on Thursday night for the first time this year.

3 – Number of times over the course of the last three seasons that P.K. Subban has hit the 50-point plateau, accomplishing that feat once again on Thursday night with a two-point effort.

         <title>The right direction</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=871978</link>
         <description>BROSSARD -- Without giving an exact date for his return to action, Carey Price confirmed on Thursday that he’s moving in the right direction.

Out of the lineup since suffering a lower-body injury on November 25, Price has spent the last 14 weeks working to get back into his familiar spot between the pipes. Some have suggested that the 28-year-old sit out the rest of the season to make sure he’s 100 percent healthy heading into the 2016-17 campaign, but following his selection as one of the first 16 players named to the Team Canada roster at this summer’s World Cup of Hockey, the 2015 NHL MVP made it clear that his goal has always been a swift return, whether it be to represent his country or his club.

“Obviously I wanted to be named to Team Canada. It’s an honor to represent our country and it’s going to be a fun tournament,” acknowledged Price. “We’ve all been participants in the process, both the Canadiens and Hockey Canada. Coming back this year and playing before the World Cup might help [for the tournament], but that won’t change my preparation.”

With the team currently on the outside-looking-in on the playoff picture, Price also stressed that his plans to return won’t change depending on the Canadiens’ spot in the standings when he finally gets the green light.

“Coming back this season has been my goal this entire process -- it’s never been a goal for me to not play. The position we’re in doesn’t change anything. I want to go out there and play hockey as quickly as possible. I want to go out there and play the game I love. It’s not a matter of protecting me, since I’m going to go play regardless. I’d rather do it sooner than later,” stressed Price, who met the media on Thursday for the first time since December after being named one of Team Canada’s three netminders for the September event. “It’s been very difficult. I was dealt a bad hand in getting injured and I’ve been out longer than expected. It’s been difficult mentally, but at the same time, I’ve kept driving every day and I’ve kept my eye on my goal, which has kept me pushing.”

Despite the incertitude which has surrounded his return over several months now, Price was moved by the support the team has shown him to date. Never pressured to return before he was ready, the 2014 Olympic gold medalist revealed he’s even been in the dressing room on several occasions to return the favor.

Now, after a grueling rehabilitation process, the eight-year NHL veteran can finally begin to see a light at the end of the tunnel.

“I’m just continuing the process, which has been a really long one obviously. It’s been slowly progressing. These last couple of weeks I’ve felt like I’ve started to turn the corner and that I’m headed in the right direction. Skating on the ice with full equipment has been proof of that,” underlined Price, who was back on the ice taking shots from David Desharnais on Thursday morning. “To be able to be back on the ice, putting in some real work has been fun for me. I feel really good on the ice, and I’m progressing, especially this last week with my equipment on. I’ve been really pushing my limits more and more.”

And while suiting up for the Habs and Team Canada remain his top priorities, Price did suggest that he might take a pass on the World Championships should that opportunity present itself -- but not without good reason.

“I’m going to be a new dad, April 29 is going to be the birth of my first child and I don’t know if my wife is going to let me go,” joked Price. “But it’s not just that. [The birth of my child] is something that I want to experience, it’s a life experience that I want to partake in to the fullest. It’s something which has kept me grounded throughout all of this as well.”

         <description>LOS ANGELES – Valeri Bure is loving life in the Golden State these days.

Nearly two decades after his three-and-half-year stint with the Canadiens came to an end, the now 41-year-old father of three is enjoying spending time with family in Southern California while pursuing a passion for winemaking with a label of his own based in the Napa Valley.

Bure and his wife, actress, producer, author and talk show panelist, Candace Cameron, are the proud parents of 17-year-old Natasha, 16-year-old Lev, and 14-year-old Maksim. They’ll celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary in June after tying the knot while Bure was still plying his trade in Montreal as a youngster.

“It’s been a quick 20 years, especially when you’re in the midst of everything going on. Looking back, we have three amazing kids that we’re super proud of. We’re still doing what we love. We’ve been blessed beyond what we can imagine with a great lifestyle. I played in the NHL and Candace has been busy acting. I absolutely love being with my kids and producing some of the best wine in the world,” said Bure, who was a second-round pick of the Canadiens – 33rd overall – in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft after a standout rookie season with the WHL’s Spokane Chiefs.

Family trips to Napa County are commonplace for the Bures, when time permits of course. Their label – Bure Family Wines – is based in St. Helena, CA, in the heart of wine country. Interestingly enough, Valeri’s interest in wine actually dates back to his tenure with the CH.

“Some of the guys on the team always liked to have a glass of wine with their meals. I wasn’t a big drinker, but after having a glass here and there and really starting to understand the concept, quality and different varietals, I took a strong interesting in it. Then, I started traveling the world tasting and my passion just grew. I went from buying and storing bottles in a small fridge to a bigger fridge to a walk-in fridge, and now I own a label,” said Bure, who released his first vintage back in 2006.

“What I like about winemaking is that every year it brings a new challenge. There’s never a dull moment. You're dealing with droughts or wet weather. Something always has to be adjusted, whether it’s with the harvest, the blending or the barrels. You’re always chasing perfection. It never ends,” added Bure. “On top of that, it’s a lifestyle. Napa is all about food, family, friends and wine. That’s really dear to my heart. It’s the perfect place to be easygoing and enjoy time together.”

When Bure isn’t upstate, you’ll likely find him at a local rink working with his sons, both of whom play competitively with the Los Angeles Jr. Kings Hockey Club. Lev is playing at the Midget 16AAA level, while Maksim is currently a member of the Bantam AAA Minor squad. Candace is a mainstay at the rink, too, even making the trip from New York, on occasion – where she co-hosts ABC’s The View – back to Los Angeles the same day to catch her boys’ on-ice workouts.

“I pick them up from school and we spend two, three or even four hours a day at the rink. Probably every other weekend, we’re traveling somewhere for tournaments – Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Vancouver. It’s fun to be able to see them grow. You’re proud of them for competing, for standing up and being there ready for practice and games. They love it. They work hard. They love the dressing room. I really fell in love with hockey all over again from the parent point of view. Candace enjoys it also,” said Bure, who is a firm believer that hockey can be a positive influence on youngsters of all ages. “It teaches my kids accountability, teamwork and work ethic. That’s something they can carry with them for the rest of their lives, no matter what they choose to do professionally. I think it’s a fantastic opportunity for them.”

Natasha, meanwhile, is eager to follow in Candace’s footsteps and pursue a career in showbiz. Bure says his eldest child “loves singing, dancing and acting” and possesses a “beautiful voice and outgoing personality.” That shouldn’t come as much of a shock given her mom’s extensive Hollywood resume that includes, among many other credits, an eight-year run as D.J. Tanner on the hit American sitcom Full House. With the release of the Netflix spinoff Fuller House last Friday – and Candace reprising her old role – it wouldn’t be at all surprising if Natasha’s acting bug was at an all-time high.

“We attended all of the tapings they did last year, and we were at the premiere also. It’s very exciting to see all those guys again, from Bob [Saget] to John [Stamos] to Dave [Coulier]. I’ve known them for over 20 years, but I’d never seen them on stage performing on Full House. That was a lot of fun. It was one big reunion,” shared Bure, who was introduced to Cameron by Coulier at a charity hockey game in Los Angeles in 1995. “The chemistry on that show is really, really amazing. All these years later, it’s like they never left.”

Bure's memories of his time in Montreal make it seem like he never left the city, either. In his mind, there really isn’t any hockey market quite like it.

“It’s such a special place. I don’t think I appreciated it enough when I was there. I really did love every minute of it, though. From being drafted at the Forum and putting on the jersey for the first time, to going to training camp, making the team and playing as a 20-year-old, it was a unique experience. I also really enjoyed the culture the city has to offer. It meant a lot to begin my career there,” said Bure, who debuted with the Canadiens in 1994-95 and went on to play on the so-called “Smurf Line” alongside Saku Koivu and Oleg Petrov one year later. “One of the things that really stood out was on game days, especially when we were playing at the Forum. You didn’t have to get mentally ready to play because the minute you stepped into the rink, with the atmosphere and history around you, your blood just started to flow and you had no other feeling but to go out there and compete. I will remember that for the rest of my life. Sometimes, I wish I would have ended my career in Montreal just to experience it again.”

Bure recalls learning the tricks of the NHL trade from the likes of Mike Keane, Kirk Muller, Lyle Odelein, Vincent Damphousse, Vladimir Malakhov, Mark Recchi and Patrick Roy in the infancy of his 10-year NHL career. It didn’t hurt to be surrounded by Canadiens Hall-of-Famers, either, all of whom were eager to pass along their wisdom and knowledge to the next generation of Habs regulars.

“Some of those guys don’t have enough fingers to wear all of their Stanley Cup rings,” cracked Bure, who would like to bring his whole family to Montreal sometime soon for a trip down memory lane. “They were really down to earth. It was amazing to see how helpful they wanted to be. They’d been in these situations before. They’d won at every level. When guys like Steve Shutt and Yvan Cournoyer came down to the dressing room, it was a very humbling experience for us. Our group was very strong because of the players we had and the support of the legends. To me, it’s the best club in the NHL, by far. Montreal will always have a special place in my heart.”

         <title>Game Preview: Canadiens @ Kings</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=871919</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (30-28-6) vs. Kings (37-21-4)

TV: RDS, SNE 10:30 p.m.

In the second of back-to-back road games, the Canadiens and Kings square off at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. 

Just 24-hours ago, the Canadiens forced their game against the Anaheim Ducks into overtime thanks to two goals off the stick of Alex Galchenyuk. Defenseman P.K. Subban registered his 43 assist of the campaign in the loss, while Andrei Markov chipped in his 31st helper of the season. 

The Los Angeles Kings have yet to play a game this week since being defeated by the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday. Prior to Sunday night’s loss to the Ducks, the Kings had strung together a four-game win streak with victories over the Predators, Flames, Oilers and Sabres. 

Jonathan Quick is expected to earn the start for the Kings after shutting out the Canadiens in the first match-up between the two teams this season. 

In the Canadiens crease, netminder Ben Scrivens is expected to get the start between the pipes after Mike Condon kept the Habs in the game against Anaheim with some clutch saves. With back-to-back games on tap it is likely that Michel Therrien gives the nod to the Spruce Grove, Alberta native. Mike Brown will take Sven Andrighetto's place in the lineup. 

The Kings hold a 1-0 advantage in the season series after picking up a 3-0 shutout victory back on December 12, 2015.</description>

         <title>Post-game Notebook: March 2</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=871852</link>
         <description>ANAHEIM – In Wednesday night’s post-game notebook, Alex Galchenyuk reflects on a strong effort, Michael McCarron talks physicality, and Morgan Ellis discusses his NHL debut.

PURE POWER: If Anaheim Ducks netminder John Gibson took anything away from Wednesday night’s contest at Honda Center, it’s that Alex Galchenyuk might just have one of the best shots around. On two occasions, the sheer force of Galchenyuk’s blasts were too much for Gibson to handle. It marked the fourth time this season that the Canadiens’ No. 27 had registered a multi-goal effort, tops amongst all players on the roster during the 2015-16 campaign.

Nevertheless, the Milwaukee, WI native wasn’t focusing on his efforts, in particular, in the aftermath of the Canadiens’ 3-2 shootout defeat. Instead, Galchenyuk reflected on the game as a whole, which saw Michel Therrien’s troops come up just short against a Western Conference powerhouse that just happens to be an elite squad on home ice.

“A game like this is such a close game. It could have gone either way. It’s unfortunate that we ended up being on the losing side again. We played a pretty great team. We showed up and competed and made plays. It was fun to play,” said Galchenyuk, who scored his 18th and 19th goals of the year in the loss playing alongside Lars Eller and young gun Michael McCarron – and also generated a game-high six shots on net. “I think the penalties killed the momentum a little bit. There were some tough calls, but that’s part of the game. Stuff happens. We’ve got a game on Thursday night, so we’ve got to bounce back.”

Galchenyuk, meanwhile, enjoyed playing with McCarron on the same trio.

“I thought he was pretty strong. He’s a big guy. He wins the battles down low and created space for me and Lars,” shared Galchenyuk. “It’s one game, so we’ve got to keep going and keep creating offense and be solid defensively also.”

STRENGTH ON DISPLAY: When Ducks defenseman Kevin Bieksa took a run at Lars Eller late in the second period, Michael McCarron didn’t hesitate to step in and go toe-to-toe with the veteran rearguard. McCarron held his own, letting his teammates know he’s got their backs when any one of them finds themselves in a tough spot.

“If I’m on the ice and someone gets buried like that, I’m going to step in. That wasn’t a very clean hit, either,” said McCarron, who had four fights on the year with the AHL’s St. John’s IceCaps before electing to drop the gloves with Bieksa on Wednesday night. “It’s a part of the game. I’m going to have to do that.”

McCarron also appreciated the opportunity to play with Lars Eller and Alex Galchenyuk against a highly-skilled Ducks squad that really is a force to be reckoned with.

“I thought I played pretty well tonight. I thought my line created a couple of scoring chances,” said McCarron, who saw 13:26 of playing time and dished out three hits. “Chucky got a couple of goals. I thought our whole team played a strong game. We just needed to find a way to win.”

THE FIRST OF MANY: Defenseman Morgan Ellis made his NHL debut on Wednesday night, and while it didn’t end with the Canadiens coming out on top, the 23-year-old has a lot to be proud of with respect to his performance on the blue line. Ellis played a steady game while logging 10:31 of ice time – and chipped in with a couple of shots, too, along the way.

“I felt good. At the morning skate, you try and get some of the jitters out, but there’s still a lot more to start the game. Once I got my first shift out there, though, I just tried to settle in and play poised and in control,” said Ellis, who hit the ice for 16 shifts during his first taste of NHL action. “For the most part, it wasn’t too bad [a performance], but there still are some areas to improve on, for sure.”

In his post-game press conference, head coach Michel Therrien said that the Prince Edward Island native had played well enough to earn another shot on Thursday night in Los Angeles. This time around, those so-called “jitters” certainly won’t be as present as they were in Ellis’ mind in Anaheim.

“I’ll know what to expect a little bit more, I guess,” said Ellis, referencing any and all opportunities down the road to sport the CH for real. “The game is quick out there, so you’ve got to make quick plays and be ready to take hits because that’s how these big teams play. I’ll try to make the most of [the opportunity to play].”

Prior to the tilt, Ellis’ teammates made him feel right at home by sending him out to take the warm-up by himself before joining him a few seconds later. 

“Subby told me to lead the boys out, so I knew exactly what was going on,” cracked Ellis. “I figured that I’d be doing a lap by myself and they would be coming behind me. It’s all part of it. It was fun. It was a great experience. It’s one I’ll remember for a long time.”

         <title>The Numbers Game: March 2, 2016</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=871850</link>
         <description>ANAHEIM - Here's a numerical look at Wednesday night's game against the Ducks in Anaheim. 

2:03 – Time it took Morgan Ellis to register his first career shot on goal in the NHL ranks as the 23-year-old defenseman tested Anaheim Ducks netminder John Gibson during his first shift of the night. 

16 – Number of players who’ve donned the CH for the very first time during the 2015-16 campaign, with Ellis and Stefan Matteau adding their names to the list on Wednesday night at the Honda Center by suiting up against Anaheim.

2 – Number of players in the NHL this season who’ve registered at least one shot in every single one of their team’s games, including Vancouver’s Daniel Sedin and Canadiens captain Max Pacioretty. The New Canaan, CT native kept that streak alive by testing Gibson during the opening frame.

527 – Number of points defenseman Andrei Markov has managed to collect over the course of his NHL career, adding to that tally on Wednesday night with an assist on Alex Galchenyuk’s goal in the second period. That point tied the Russian rearguard with Hector “Toe” Blake for 20th spot on the Canadiens’ all-time points list.

7 – Number of times over the course of his NHL career that Andrei Markov has surpassed the 30-assist mark in a single season, accomplishing that feat once again on Wednesday night by assisting on Galchenyuk’s goal in the second frame. Markov has put up over 30 assists in each of the last three seasons.

28 – Percentage of games played by defenseman Alexei Emelin this season in which he’s been particularly rough on the opposing team by dishing out at least five hits during the course of a contest. The Ducks were no exception on Wednesday night.

4 – Number of times that Michael McCarron has dropped the gloves during the 2015-16 campaign as a member of the St. John’s IceCaps, before doing the same thing on Wednesday night in Anaheim by going toe-to-toe with veteran Kevin Bieksa following a hit on Lars Eller.

17 – Number of players selected in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft who've surpassed the 150-point mark in their respective NHL careers, including P.K. Subban, Max Pacioretty and now Lars Eller after he picked up a helper in the opening frame.

4 – Number of times this season in which Alex Galchenyuk has scored more than once in a single game, leading the Canadiens in that department by a single effort over Max Pacioretty following Wednesday night’s performance.

2 – Number of NHL teams against which Alex Galchenyuk has registered a point per game over the course of his NHL career, including the Philadelphia Flyers (12 points in 11 games) and now the Anaheim Ducks (5 points in 5 games) following a two-goal performance on Wednesday night.

         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=871777</link>
         <description>Game Preview: Canadiens (30-28-5) vs. Ducks (34-19-8)
TV: RDS, SNE 10:00 p.m.

The Habs and Ducks clash for the first time this season, just 24-hours before the Canadiens are set to take on the Kings in Los Angeles.
  
Mere hours after a busy trade deadline, Michel Therrien’s troops took on the San Jose Sharks in the first leg of their 4-game western road trip. Brendan Gallagher and Torrey Mitchell lit the lamp for the Canadiens in a 6-2 loss to the surging Sharks. 

The Anaheim Ducks - presently the NHL’s hottest team – extended their league leading win streak to eight games with a 4-2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings on Sunday night. Corey Perry led the way in the scoring department with a four point night including a hat trick that was capped off in the 3rd period. 

John Gibson is expected to get the start between the pipes for the Ducks after picking up victories over the Los Angeles Kings and Calgary Flames last week. 

Following Wednesday's practice in Anaheim, the Canadiens confirmed that both Stefan Matteau and Morgan Ellis will suit up and make their team debuts against the Ducks. As a result, Victor Bartley and Mike Brown will sit-out Wednesday night's contest.  Meanwhile, rookie Michael McCarron now finds himself on a line completed by Alex Galchenyuk and Lars Eller. 

Between the pipes, Mike Condon is expected to earn his sixth consecutive start after his four-game point streak was snapped on Monday night in San Jose. The rookie goaltender has yet to face the Anaheim Ducks thus far through his NHL career.</description>

         <title>North to the Future</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=870466</link>
         <description>MONTREAL – Nikolas Koberstein is proud to call Alaska his collegiate hockey home.

One of eight freshmen currently plying their trade at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the 20-year-old defenseman – who was drafted 125th overall by the Canadiens in 2014 – has spent the last six months learning the NCAA game under the watchful eye of veteran bench boss, Dallas Ferguson, while growing accustomed to life nearly 3,000 kilometers from his family’s ranch – a cow-calf operation – in Alberta.

“It’s definitely very unique up here. There are lots of different things to get used to, the temperature and the snow, but Fairbanks is a beautiful town. There are a little over 30,000 people in the city, and 100,000 outside of it. It’s a fairly small community, but it’s just so closely knit together. The people are great,” said Koberstein, who grew up in Barrhead, a town of just 4,000 people located about 120 kilometers northwest of Edmonton. “Living up here with my teammates has been a good experience, too. We’re always together – at practice, in the gym, in class, traveling. It forms a good bond. You really get close because of it. It’s been special.”

On the ice, Koberstein has patrolled the Nanooks’ blue line for 23 games during the 2015-16 campaign, doing his very best to meet the unavoidable hurdles that come with making the jump from the Junior ranks to a highly-competitive league like the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). If anything, it’s been an important learning experience for the former AJHL and USHL standout, who has accepted the challenge head on.

“It was a little bit interesting to start with. There was some learning to do because it’s definitely a different game. You’re playing against bigger, stronger and faster guys – going from Junior to playing against guys who could be 24 or 25 years old. The strength and quickness of the game is a lot higher, so it’s a very good league for development,” said the 6-foot-2, 195-pound rearguard, a business administration major, who notched his first career collegiate tally back on Jan. 2 in a two-point effort against Bemidji State. “There aren’t as many games [as in Junior]. We play on Friday and Saturday nights, so we can really focus on pushing ourselves during practice and workouts all week long.”

Koberstein has placed a strong emphasis on improving his skating ability this season – and with good reason. The Nanooks’ play their home games at the Carlson Center on an Olympic-sized rink, so being able to cover as much ice as possible – as quickly as possible – is a key attribute for any defender competing in that type of environment.

“Skating is one of the most important things for me right now, especially at this higher pace. There’s the bigger ice. That’s one thing. Skating and decision-making also go hand-in-hand. If you’re decisive, but you’re not a good skater, it doesn’t matter how fast you make a decision to go ahead with a play,” explained Koberstein. “I’m also working on staying aggressive and avoiding being hesitant. I was a little bit cautious coming into this new league playing against guys I wasn’t familiar with at all. I’ve felt more comfortable and confident every game, though. This season has been all about improvement and pushing myself. I want to come in as a sophomore and be an impact player.”

Ferguson has played a key role in Koberstein feeling right at home in the Alaskan Interior as the pair actually have a lot in common. In addition to being an Albertan, Ferguson also played at UAF and was a defenseman, too. It’s been easy for the Nanooks’ No. 5 to relate to his new bench boss since relocating to Fairbanks last summer.

“Dallas has been fantastic for me so far. He always focuses on improving his players and makes time for each one individually. That individual attention is fantastic. He also played pro hockey, so he knows what it takes to take your game to another level. Taking advice from him has been extremely beneficial and we really work well together,” praised Koberstein, who was sold on attending Alaska-Fairbanks following a visit with Ferguson back in Alberta. “He’s been in my shoes before. He’s been through the ropes like me and knows the course I’m on.”

It didn’t hurt Koberstein’s cause to embark on his collegiate career with some NHL experience in his back pocket, either. He’s attended the Canadiens’ development camps during the last two summers, which also boosted his confidence heading into a new chapter in his hockey life.

“You can really learn a lot if you pay close attention to the guys you’re around while you’re there, how they act, what they do. You learn from their habits. It’s important to take things away and incorporate them into your own game. Now, I have a lot of support from [director of player development] Martin Lapointe and [player development coach] Rob Ramage,” said Koberstein, who also benefitted from the support of another fellow Albertan while in Brossard this past summer. “Daniel Carr kind took me under his wing while I was there. He’s such an amazing guy. We played in the same league when I was there in Alberta, so we have that connection. He really taught me a lot.”

That being said, it hasn’t been the easiest of campaigns for the Nanooks, who are battling to secure a spot in the WCHA playoffs right now. With just six conference wins this season, Ferguson’s contingent currently sits ninth, two points back of Alaska Anchorage with two games remaining against their in-state rival to close out the year this coming weekend. The top eight clubs earn a coveted postseason berth.

“It’s been an extremely challenging year, but that can definitely make guys better in the long run. Adversity isn’t a bad thing. We’re all pulling towards the same goal. We’re all trying to improve and win as a team. It’s good that we’re all moving in the same direction together,” explained Koberstein. “Obviously, we haven’t had the results that we want. We’re still working on it. Right now, we’re staying positive and focusing on making that final playoff push.”

As for Koberstein himself, the plan going forward is simple.

“I just want to keep getting better. I want to finish the year with a bang and make sure I’m just doing things the right way,” said Koberstein, who lists Brent Seabrook, Johnny Boychuk and Chris Pronger among his NHL role models over the years. “I want to get closer to what the Nanooks – and the Canadiens down the road – need me to be. I’m always trying to take another step forward.”

         <title>San Jose struggles</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=871385</link>
         <description>SAN JOSE – Northern California hasn’t been kind to the Canadiens in recent years. Unfortunately, history repeated itself once again on Monday night.

The Canadiens dropped their ninth straight decision to the San Jose Sharks on their home turf, falling 6-2 at the SAP Center to begin a four-game road trip. The last time the Habs managed to secure a victory at the building on West Santa Clara St. dates back to November 23, 1999 when the Sharks’ home rink was still known as the San Jose Arena.

“They’re a good team, obviously. We know that. We knew that on this road trip we were going to play some very good teams. But, for us, I don’t think we can be happy enough with our effort. We allowed them to have too much time and space. Good players are going to take advantage of it,” said Brendan Gallagher, who scored his 18th goal of the season on Monday night. “There are things that we can control every game. Our compete level and our battle level wasn’t where it needed to be.”

That was certainly the case come the start of the final frame. Down 3-2, the Canadiens allowed Pete DeBoer’s contingent to score two quick goals early that essentially zapped any momentum they’d established after cutting San Jose’s lead to a single tally through 40 minutes of play. Melker Karlsson and Nick Spaling’s goals at 2:14 and 3:37, respectively, ultimately put the contest out of reach for good.

“We weren’t good enough in the last 20. We were just a step behind. You do that against this team and they’re going to make you look bad. They made us look bad in the third,” said Lars Eller, referencing not only San Jose’s three third period goals, but also being outshot by a 14-6 margin along the way. “There’s absolutely no excuse. They had a trade deadline, too. They had a game last night. They were just better than us in the third. Plain and simple.”

It didn’t help the Canadiens’ cause that the Sharks’ top snipers were on top of their game from start to finish, either. Joe Thornton and Joe Pavelski racked up three points each in the win, with Pavelski beating goaltender Mike Condon on two occasions, including late in the third period to cap the scoring.

“They had a lot of good looks and they buried them. That’s hockey sometimes, and we’ve got to be better,” said Condon, who stopped 30 of the 36 shots fired in his direction. “We’ve just to compete better. I thought they worked really hard behind the net and they did a really good job keeping pucks in at the blue line. I think they just outworked us.”

Head coach Michel Therrien didn’t mince words in his post-game press conference as his hockey club fell seven points out of a wild card spot with 19 games remaining on the schedule.
“We had a tough time getting engaged in this game. They were better than we were,” said Therrien, who will lead the Canadiens into Anaheim for their next outing on Wednesday night. 

“Nights like these are going to happen. We have a very young team right now. There are 
nights that are going to be tougher than others. This was one of those nights.”

         <description>SAN JOSE - Here's a numerical look at Monday night's game against the Sharks in San Jose. 

2,528 – Number of days that have elapsed since February 27, 2009, the day that the Canadiens claimed Glen Metropolit off waivers from the Philadelphia Flyers, and Metropolit went up against his former team that night. The same scenario repeated itself on February 29, 2016 when Mike Brown woke up as a member of the Sharks before being claimed by the Canadiens and suiting up against his former squad hours later.

10 – Number of times in NHL history in which the Canadiens have played a game on February 29, the last time coming back in 2008 against the Buffalo Sabres. The first time they played on that day was in 1936 against the Maroons.

14 – Number of players who’ve donned a Canadiens jersey for the first time during the 2015-16 campaign, with Mike Brown being the latest player to do so on Monday.

4 – Number of players still active in the NHL ranks who suited up during the Canadiens’ last win in Northern California dating back to November 23, 1999. They include Dainius Zubrus, Mike Ribeiro, Brad Stuart and Patrick Marleau.

1,551 – Number of days that have elapsed since Erik Cole scored the Canadiens’ last goal at the SAP Center on December 1, 2011, before Brendan Gallagher put an end to that streak with a goal in the first period against Sharks netminder Martin Jones from an impossible angle.

43 – Number of assists P.K. Subban has amassed since the start of the year, with the Norris Trophy winning rearguard now occupying second spot among the league’s rearguardS in that department by picking up a helper on Gallagher’s tally. Senators captain Erik Karlsson sits first.

8 – Number of players drafted in 2010 who’ve surpassed the 150-point mark in their respective NHL careers, with Brendan Gallagher joining the likes of Taylor Hall, Tyler Seguin and Jeff Skinner by picking up the 151st point of his career on Monday night.

10 – Number of players from the 2007 NHL Draft class who boast at least 275 points on their resumes. P.K. Subban and Max Pacioretty are on that list, both of whom picked up assists on Gallagher’s goal in San Jose.

23 – Number of Canadiens players who’ve picked up at least one point this season, with Phillip Danault adding himself to that list on Monday night by registering an assist on Torrey Mitchell’s goal in the second period.

23 – Number of Canadiens players who’ve picked up at least one point this season, with Phillip Danault adding his name to that list on Monday night by registering an assist on Torrey Mitchell’s goal in the second period.

7 – Number of goals Torrey Mitchell has scored this season, his best tally since the 2011-12 campaign when he scored nine times as a member of the Sharks. Interestingly enough, Mitchell’s seventh goal of the year came against his former club on Monday night.

2 – Number of players the Canadiens acquired on Monday who are Chicago natives, including Mike Brown and Stefan Matteau. Both forwards list the Windy City as their respective hometowns.

         <title>A fresh start</title>
         <link>http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=871478</link>
         <description>MONTREAL - Just moments before the 2016 trade deadline crept past the 3:00 p.m. cut-off-time, came the news that the Canadiens had made a last minute deal. 

In his second roster move of the day, general manager Marc Bergevin acquired forward Stefan Matteau from the New Jersey Devils, in return for winger Devante Smith-Pelly. The announcement of the trade came on the heels of the news that the Habs had claimed Mike Brown off waivers from the San Jose Sharks. 

Matteau - a former first round pick by the Devils back in 2012 – has had his 2015-16 season limited to just 20 games due to a nasty injury. On January 14, Matteau was placed on the injured reserve after he was struck in the face by a deflected puck during practice and suffered a facial fracture.  

The 22-year-old winger had just returned to New Jersey following a one-game conditioning stint spent with the Albany Devils of the AHL, before he was ultimately dealt to the Canadiens. 

"I didn't get to play as much as I'd like with the Devils, but right now I am concentrating on the future and I'm just excited to be a Hab," noted the former member of the QMJHL’s Blainville-Boisbriand Armada and USHL’s U.S. National Development Team. “I'm still young and will continue to develop my game. I see myself as a goal scorer that can play with a physical edge too.” 

The Chicago, Illinois native also has experience on international stage, where he represented Team USA at the 2014 World Junior Championships. Moreover, Matteau also plied his trade with the Albany Devils of the AHL, where he would pick up a total of 53 points (25 goals, 28 assists) and 110 penalty minutes in 129 career games. 

Smith-Pelly for his part heads to New Jersey after suiting up for 66 games with the Canadiens since being acquired in exchange for Jiri Sekac on February 24, 2015. The 23-year-old winger, who had trouble finding a regular spot in Michel Therrien’s lineup this season, should get an opportunity to showcase his talents as the Devils continue their fight for one of the remaining playoff spots in the Eastern Conference.

Meanwhile, Matteau - who has a total of 44 games of NHL experience to his credit - is expected to join the Canadiens in Los Angeles on their current road trip out west. 

Interestingly, I guess you could say that being dealt on trade deadline day runs in the family. For the Habs newest addition became the second member of the Matteau clan to get traded on the infamous deadline day, as his father - and former Ranger Stephane Matteau - went through a similar experience in March of 1994.

“I had the chance to talk to my father after the trade and we both see it as a new beginning,” concluded the former junior standout, who grossed 47 points (28 goals, 19 assists) in 81 games at the junior level.

The trade deadline can often be a nerve-wracking experience for both players and loyal fans, Matteau for one counts himself lucky to have his father to turn to for advice on such an unpredictable day.

         <description>SAN JOSE – After adding young gun Phillip Danault to the mix late last week, general manager Marc Bergevin kept on working the phones leading up to Monday afternoon’s trade deadline.

While things were relatively quiet on the whole, Bergevin completed two additional transactions before 3 p.m. EST, claiming veteran Mike Brown off waivers from the San Jose Sharks prior to the morning skate, before shipping Devante Smith-Pelly to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for young gun Stefan Matteau minutes after the on-ice session had come to a close.

Sporting No. 13, Brown hit the ice with the rest of Michel Therrien’s troops ahead of Monday night’s tilt against his now-former club. He skated on a line with Michael McCarron and Torrey Mitchell. With 393 NHL games under his belt, the 30-year-old Chicago native brings good experience and some added strength to the Canadiens’ lineup. Brown also has 751 career penalty minutes to his credit since making his NHL debut in 2007-08.

“We know his role. We have a lot of young players on this team right now to finish the year. I’m happy that I was able to go out and get a guy like that with team toughness to help them out,” said Bergevin, referencing Brown’s team-leading seven fights with the Sharks this season before being dealt to Montreal.

Matteau, meanwhile, is a player Bergevin has high hopes for down the road. The 22-year-old forward, who was selected 29th overall by New Jersey back in 2012, has played 44 NHL games over the last four seasons – 20 during the 2015-16 campaign alone. While he’s spent the bulk of his time in the AHL ranks in recent years, Bergevin believes there’s plenty of upside to his game.

“He’s a young player who hasn’t reached his full potential just yet. That’s one of the reasons why he was available. He’ll have the opportunity to get involved in Montreal and it will be up to him to seize his chance,” said Bergevin, who has had his eye on Matteau for quite some time. “He’s a guy with good size and good skating ability. He’s a player we wanted to select [in Chicago] when he was draft eligible. We think we can develop him in Montreal because it didn’t work out in New Jersey.”

Like Matteau, Bergevin believes Danault will also be a piece of the puzzle going forward. In a trade that sent Dale Weise and Tomas Fleischmann to Chicago, Bergevin believes the Canadiens added another up-and-coming youngster to the fold with a bright future ahead of him.

“He’s good everywhere on the ice. He’s good on draws. I don’t expect him to put up an 80 percent faceoff percentage, but I think he’ll continue to improve in that department. He’s still young, but at the same time, he’s someone who is ready to play in the NHL,” said Bergevin. “He was developed in a very good organization and I’m happy to have him in Montreal.”

Now, Bergevin will be paying very close attention to the way things play out the rest of the way, beginning with Monday night’s contest at the SAP Center. Youth has clearly been the focus for the Canadiens as of late, and under Bergevin’s watch it will remain the focus in the years to come.

“I’d say that for the next 20 games, our primary objectives are experience and evaluation. There’s a possibility of calling up guys from St. John’s to evaluate them, too,” said Bergevin. “The ideal scenario is to get a youngster [in trades] because that way you’re adding a piece instead of trying to fill a hole. I’m coming from Chicago where we built the team up through the NHL Draft by getting young players. That’s the best way to do it.”

         <description>MONTREAL (February 29, 2016) – Montreal Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin announced today the acquisition of forward Stefan Matteau from the New Jersey Devils, in return for forward Devante Smith-Pelly.

Matteau, 22, appeared in 20 games with the Devils, registering 1 goal, 13 penalty minutes and 39 hits, while playing an average of 10:04 per game. The 6’2’’ and 220 lbs forward added four penalty minutes in one game with the AHL’s Albany Devils.

In 44 career games in the NHL, Matteau has collected five points (3 goals, 2 assists) and 23 penalty minutes. He contributed 53 points (25 goals, 28 assists) and 110 penalty minutes in 129 career games in the AHL.

On the international stage, Matteau suited up for Team USA at the World Junior Championship in 2014, collecting four points (3 goals, 1 assist) and 10 penalty minutes in five games.

A native of Chicago, Illinois, Matteau was the Devils’ first round pick, 29th overall, of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. A product of the QMJHL’s Blainville-Boisbriand Armada and USHL’s U.S. National Development Team, he produced 47 points (28 goals, 19 assists) in 81 games at the junior level.

Devante Smith-Pelly, 23, registered 12 points (6 goals, 6 assists) and 22 penalty minutes in 46 games with the Canadiens thus far this season. The Scarborough, Ontario native was acquired by the Canadiens from the Anaheim Ducks in return for Jiri Sekac on February 24, 2015.</description>
